"A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools. -- Douglas Adams",
"'A cucumber is bitter.' Throw it away. 'There are briars in the road.' Turn aside from them. This is enough. Do not add, 'And why were such things made in the world?' -- Marcus Aurelius",
"A democracy is a state which recognises the subjecting of the minority to the majority. -- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin",
"A fear of weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity. -- Sigmund Freud",
"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. -- Ralph Waldo Emerson",
"A healthy appetite for righteousness, kept in due control by good manners, is an excellent thing; but to 'hunger and thirst' after it is often merely a symptom of spiritual diabetes. -- Charlie D. Broad",
"A hundred years ago there lived a philosopher named Jeremy Bentham, who was universally recognized to be a very wicked man. I remember to this day the first time that I came across his name when I was a boy. It was in a statement by the Rev. Sydney Smith to the effect that Bentham thought people ought to make soup of their dead grandmothers. The practice appeared to me as undesirable from a culinary as from a moral point of view, and I therefore conceived a bad opinion of Bentham. -- Bertrand Russell",
"A lot of people now find belief in God immature, and eventually a lot of people may find realism immature. -- Richard Rorty",
"A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death. -- Albert Einstein",
"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it. -- Max Planck",
"A scientist can hardly meet with anything more undesirable than to have the foundations give way just as the work is finished. I was put in this position by a letter from Mr. Bertrand Russell when the work was nearly through the press. -- Gottlob Frege",
"A single sentence will suffice for modern man: he fornicated and read the papers. -- Albert Camus",
"A slight perusal of the laws by which the measures of vindictive and coercive justice are established will discover so many disproportions between crimes and punishments, such capricious distinctions of guilt, and such confusion of remissness and severity as can scarcely be believed to have been produced by public wisdom, sincerely and calmly studious of public happiness. -- Samuel Johnson",
"A spectre is haunting the world - the spectre of communism. -- Karl Marx",
"A tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion. Subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider god-fearing and pious. On the other hand, they do less easily move against him, believing that he has the gods on his side. -- Aristotle",
"A woman does not want the truth; what is truth to women?  From the beginning, nothing has been more alien, repugnant, and hostile to woman than the truth - her great art is the lie, her highest concern is mere appearance and beauty. -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"A year later the war broke out and robbed the world of its beauties. It destroyed not only the beauty of the countrysides through which it passed and the works of art which it met in its path but also shattered our pride in the achievements of civilization, our admiration for many philosophers and artists and our hopes for a final triumph over the differences between nations and races. It tarnished the lofty impartiality of science, it revealed our instincts in all their nakedness and let loose the evil spirits within us which we thought had been tamed for ever by centuries of continuous education by the noblest minds. It made our country small again and made the rest of the world far remote. It robbed us of very much that we had loved, and showed us how ephemeral were many things that we regarded as changeless. -- Sigmund Freud",
"Absolute justice is achieved by the suppression of all contradiction: therefore it destroys freedom. -- Albert Camus",
"Against the disease of writing one must take special precautions, since it is a dangerous and contagious disease. -- Peter Abelard",
"Against whom? -- Alfred Adler",
"All biologists speak of the interaction between heredity and environment. They do not, except in laboratory shorthand, speak of a gene 'causing' a particular behaviour, and they never mean it literally. That would make no more sense that its converse, the idea of behaviour arising from culture without the intervention of brain activity. -- Edward O. Wilson",
"All democrats are insane, but not one of them knows it; none but the republicans and mugwumps know it. All the republicans are insane, but only the democrats and mugwumps can perceive it. The rule is perfect: in all matters of opinion our adversaries are insane. -- Mark Twain",
"All is for the best in the best of possible worlds. -- Francois Voltaire",
"All men are liable to error; and most men are, in many points, by passion or interest, under temptation to it. -- John Locke",
"All religions, with their gods, their demi-gods, and their prophets, their messiahs and their saints, were created by the prejudiced fancy of men who had not attained the full development and full possession of their faculties. -- Michael Bakunin",
"All the choir of heaven and furniture of earth - in a word, all those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world - have not any subsistence without a mind. -- George Berkeley",
"All the qualities of a man acquire dignity when he knows that the service of the collectivity that owns him needs them. If proud of the collectivity, his own pride rises in proportion. No collectivity is like an army for nourishing such pride.... -- William James",
"All these are firmly bound by Love, which rules both earth and sea, and has its empire in the heavens too. If Love should slacken its hold, all mutual love would change to war; and these would strive to undo the scheme which now their glorious movements carry out with trust and accord. By Love are peoples too kept bound together by a treaty which they may not break. Love binds with pure affection the sacred tie of wedlock, and speaks its bidding to all trusty friends. O happy race of mortals if your hearts are ruled as is the universe, by Love. -- Boethius",
"All things were together, infinite both in number and in smallness; for the small also was infinite. And when they were all together, nothing was clear and distinct because of their smallness; for air and aether comprehended all things, both being infinite; for these are present in everything, and are greatest both as to number and as to greatness. -- Anaxagoras",
"All those who believe in telekinetics, raise my hand... -- Kurt Vonnegut",
"Almost every party grasps that it is in the interest of its own self-preservation that the opposing party should not decay in strength; the same is true of grand politics. A new creation, the new Reich for instance, has more need of enemies that friends: only in opposition does it feel itself necessary, only in opposition does it become necessary.... -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"Am I to believe in every absurdity? If not, why this one in particular? -- Sigmund Freud",
"America is Rome reincarnate. Like the Roman empire, the American empire is vastly powerful and unfathomably corrupt. Like Rome, America imposes her civilisation upon an ungrateful world. Like Rome, America needs bread, circuses and philosopher-statesmen to forestall and yet to hasten her demise. -- Lou Marinoff",
"Among the progress of the human mind that is most important for human happiness, we must count the entire destruction of the prejudices that have established inequality between the sexes, fatal even to the sex it favors. One would look in vain for reasons to justify it, by differences in physical constitution, intelligence, moral sensibility. This inequality has no other source but the abuse of power, and men have tried in vain to excuse it by sophisms. -- Marquis de Condorcet",
"An apt and true reply was given to Alexander the Great by a pirate who had been seized. For when that king had asked the man what he meant by keeping hostile possession of the sea, he answered with bold pride. 'What thou meanest by seizing the whole earth; but because I do it with a petty ship, I am called a robber, whilst thou who dost it with a great fleet art styled emperor. -- Augustine",
"An ideology is a complex of ideas or notions which represents itself to the thinker as an absolute truth for the interpretation of the world and his situation within it; it leads the thinker to accomplish an act of self-deception for the purpose of justification, obfuscation and evasion in some sense or other to his advantage. -- Karl Jaspers",
"Anarchy stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion, the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraints of government. -- Emma Goldman",
"And for mathematical science, he that doubts their certainty hath need of a dose of hellebore. -- Joseph Glanvill",
"And life is given to none freehold, but it is leasehold for all. -- Lucretius",
"And once, in spite of the men who gripped him by each shoulder, he stepped slightly aside to avoid a puddle on the path. It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle, I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive, just as we were alive. -- George Orwell",
"Any lore that widens people's horizons and presents food for thought is the beginning of philosophy. -- Chief Reuben O. Ogunyemi",
"Anyone who has had a glimpse of the range and subtlety of the thought of Plato or of a Hegel will long ago have despaired of becoming a philosopher. -- Michael Oakeshott",
"Appearances to the mind are of four kinds. Things either are what they appear to be; or they neither are, nor appear to be; or they are, and do not appear to be; or they are not, and yet appear to be. Rightly to aim in all these cases is the wise mans task. -- Epictetus",
"Architecture in general is frozen music. -- Friedrich Schelling",
"Aristotle maintained that women have fewer teeth than men; although he was twice married, it never occurred to him to verify this statement by examining his wives' mouths. -- Bertrand Russell",
"Arrogance on the part of the meritorious is even more offensive to us than the arrogance of those without merit: for merit itself is offensive. -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"Art is permitted to survive only if it renounces the right to be different, and integrates itself into the omnipotent realm of the profane. -- Theodore Adorno",
"Art is ruled uniquely by the imagination. -- Benedetto Croce",
"As long as man continues to be the ruthless destroyer of lower living beings he will never know health or peace. For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. -- Pythagoras",
"As the brain changes are continuous, so do all these consciousnesses melt into each other like dissolving views. Properly they are but one protracted consciousness, one unbroken stream. -- William James",
"As we shall see, the concept of time has no meaning before the beginning of the universe. This was first pointed out by St. Augustine. When asked: What did God do before he created the universe? Augustine didn't reply: He was preparing Hell for people who asked such questions. Instead, he said that time was a property of the universe that God created, and that time did not exist before the beginning of the universe. -- Stephen Hawking",
"As with the Christian religion, the worst advertisement for Socialism is its adherents. -- George Orwell",
"At the age of eleven, I began Euclid, with my brother as my tutor. This was one of the great events of my life, as dazzling as first love. I had not imagined there was anything so delicious in the world. From that moment until I was thirty-eight, mathematics was my chief interest and my chief source of happiness. -- Bertrand Russell",
"Atheistic existentialism, of which I am a representative, declares with greater consistency that if God does not exist there is at least one being whose existence comes before its essence, a being which exists before it can be defined by any conception of it. That being is man.... -- Jean-Paul Sartre",
"Beauty in things exists in the mind which contemplates them. -- David Hume",
"Bertrand Russell was giving a lesson on solipsism to a lay audience, and a woman got up and said she was delighted to hear Bertrand Russell say he was a solipsist; she was one too, and she wished there were more of us. -- W. H. Thorpe",
"Blameless, shameless. The more desperate the eroticism, the more hopelessly women show off their heavy breasts, opening their mouths and screaming out, the greater the attraction. In contrast, a promise of light awaits at the limits of the mystical outlook. I find this unbearable and soon returned to insolence and erotic vomit - which doesn't respect anybody or anything. How sweet to enter filthy night and proudly wrap myself in it. The whore I went with was as uncomplicated as a child and she hardly talked. There was another one, who came crashing down from a tabletop - sweet, shy, heartbreakingly tender, as I watched her with drunken, unfeeling eyes. -- Georges Bataille",
"Bow your heads to your husbands - and that will be ornament enough for you. Keep your hands busy with spinning and stay at home - and you will be more pleasing than if you were adorned in gold. Dress yourselves in the silk of probity, the fine linen of holiness, and the purple of chastity. Decked out in this manner, you will have God Himself for your lover. -- Tertullian",
"But fundamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism - something it is like for the organism. -- Thomas Nagel",
"But here steps in Satan, the eternal rebel, the first free-thinker and emancipator of worlds. He makes man ashamed of his bestial ignorance and obedience; he emancipates him, stamps upon his brow the seal of liberty and humanity, in urging him to disobey and eat of the fruit of knowledge. -- Michael Bakunin",
"But immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus thought, should be somewhat; and as I observed that this truth, I think, therefore I am, was so certain and of such evidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged by the sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might, without scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philosophy of which I was in search. -- Rene Descartes",
"Buying books would be a good thing if one could also buy the time to read them in: but as a rule the purchase of books is mistaken for the appropriation of their contents. -- Arthur Schopenhauer",
"By a 'silly' theory I mean one which may be held at the time when one is talking or writing professionally, but which only an inmate of a lunatic asylum would think of carrying into daily life....It must not be supposed that the men who maintain these theories and beliefs are 'silly' people. Only very acute and learned men could have thought of anything so odd or defended anything so preposterous against the continual protests of common sense. -- Charlie D. Broad",
"By recognizing a favorable opinion of yourself, and taking pleasure in it, you in a measure give yourself and your peace of mind into the keeping of another, of whose attitude you can never be certain. You have a new source of doubt and apprehension. -- Charles Cooley",
"By the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever, according to the tendency it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question: or, what is the same thing in other words to promote or to oppose that happiness. -- Jeremy Bentham",
"Can one be a saint if God does not exist? That is the only concrete problem I know of today. -- Albert Camus",
"Certainly it is wrong to be cruel to animals and the destruction of a whole species can be a great evil. The capacity for feelings of pleasure and pain and for the form of life of which animals are capable clearly impose duties of compassion and humanity in their case. -- John Rawls",
"Certainly one may say, Freedom to speak or write can be taken from us by a superior power, but never the freedom to think! But how much, and how correctly, would we think if we did not think, as it were, in common with others, with whom we mutually communicate! -- Immanuel Kant",
"Christ wants to slay reason and subdue the arrogance of the Jews... -- Martin Luther",
"Christianity taught that men ought to be as chaste as pagans thought honest women ought to be; the contraceptive morality teaches that women need to be as little chaste as pagans thought men need be. -- Elizabeth Anscombe",
"Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. The savage's whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man free from men. -- Ayn Rand",
"Clearly, then, the city is not a concrete jungle, it is a human zoo. -- Desmond Morris",
"Colourless green ideas sleep furiously. -- Noam Chomsky",
"Common sense is the best distributed commodity in the world, for every man is convinced that he is well supplied with it. -- Rene Descartes",
"Communism is exploitation of the strong by the weak. -- Pierre Proudhon",
"Conceit, arrogance, and egotism are the essentials of patriotism. -- Emma Goldman",
"Conflict is the original meaning of being-for-others. -- Jean-Paul Sartre",
"Consciousness is a being, the nature of which is to be conscious of the nothingness of its being. -- Jean-Paul Sartre",
"Consciousness is a word worn smooth by a million tongues. -- George Miller",
"Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies. -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"'Creation science' has not entered the curriculum for a reason so simple and so basic that we often forget to mention it: because it is false, and because good teachers understand exactly why it is false. What could be more destructive of that most fragile yet most precious commodity in our entire intellectual heritage - good teaching - than a bill forcing honorable teachers to sully their sacred trust by granting equal treatment to a doctrine not only known to be false, but calculated to undermine any general understanding of science as an enterprise? -- Stephen Jay Gould",
"Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember to pay the debt? -- Socrates",
"Cunning and deceit will every time serve a man better than force. -- Niccolo Machiavelli",
"Cut the pie any way you like, 'meanings' just ain't in the head! -- Hilary Putnam",
"Death is nothing to us, since when we are, death has not come, and when death has come, we are not. -- Epicurus",
"Death of old age is a rare, singular, and extraordinary death, and hence less natural than the others; it is the last and ultimate sort of death; the farther it is from us, the less it is to be hoped for. -- Michel de Montaigne",
"Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully. -- Samuel Johnson",
"Destroying species is like tearing pages out of an unread book, written in a language humans hardly know how to read, about the place where they live. -- Holmes Rolston III",
"Distrust everyone in whom the impulse to punish is powerful! -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"Does a man of sense run after every silly tale of hobgoblins or fairies, and canvass particularly the evidence? I never knew anyone, that examined and deliberated about nonsense who did not believe it before the end of his enquiries. -- David Hume",
"Dr J. O. Wisdom...once observed to me that he knew people who thought there was no philsophy after Hegel, and others who thought there was none before Wittgenstein; and he saw no reason for excluding the possibility that both were right. -- Ernest Gellner",
"Driving is a spectacular form of amnesia. Everything is to be discovered, everything to be obliterated. -- Jean Baudrillard",
"During the first assault of passion as under a thunder stroke the sentiments of virtue may yield for a moment. -- Jeremy Bentham",
"Each group thinks its own folkways the only right ones, and if it observes that other groups have other folkways this excites its scorn. -- William Graham Sumner",
"Each of us not only 'has', but lives a biography reflexively organised in terms of flows of social and psychological information about possible ways of life. Modernity is a post-traditional order, in which the question, 'How shall I live?' has to be answered in day-to-day decisions about how to behave, what to wear and what to eat - and many other things - as well as interpreted within the temporal unfolding of self-identity. -- Anthony Giddens",
"Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself. -- John Dewey",
"Egalitarianism has been the most corrosive, illiberal and muderous of modern beliefs. The French Revolution told us all we needed to know about equality, the driving force behind its terror and anarchy. -- Anthony O'Hear",
"Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily. -- William of Occam",
"Ethiopians make their gods black and snub-nosed, Thracians red-haired and with blue eyes; so also they conceive the spirits of the gods to be like themselves. -- Xenopohanes",
"Even if a civil society were to dissolve itself by the vote of all its members... nevertheless, before they go, the last murderer in prison must be executed. -- Immanuel Kant",
"Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing? -- Stephen Hawking",
"Even in the lost the natural inclination to virtue remains, else they would have no remorse of conscience. -- Thomas Aquinas",
"Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world. -- Arthur Schopenhauer",
"Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination. -- John Dewey",
"Every instant of time is a pinprick of eternity. All things are petty, easily changed, vanishing away. -- Marcus Aurelius",
"Every law is an evil, for every law is an infraction of liberty. -- Jeremy Bentham",
"Every miserable fool who has nothing at all of which he can be proud, adopts as a last resource pride in the nation to which he belongs; he is ready and happy to defend all its faults and follies tooth and nail, thus reimbursing himself for his own inferiority. -- Arthur Schopenhauer",
"Every possible idea therefore may be said to be used existentially, for every possible idea qualifies and is true of a real world. And the number of real worlds, in a word, is indefinite. Every idea therefore in a sense is true, and is true of reality. The question with every idea is how far and in what sense is it true. The question is always whether, qualifying reality in one sense, the idea qualifies reality in another sense also. For, true in one world, an idea may be false in another world... -- Francis H. Bradley",
"Everybody thinks himself so well supplied with common sense that even those most difficult to please...never desire more of it than they already have. -- Rene Descartes",
"Everyone has observed how much more dogs are animated when they hunt in a pack, than when they pursue their game apart. We might, perhaps, be at a loss to explain this phenomenon, if we had not experience of a similar in ourselves. -- David Hume",
"Everything must justify its existence before the judgement seat of Reason, or give up existence. -- Friedrich Engels",
"Everything is good when it leaves the hands of the Creator; everything degenerates in the hands of man. -- Jean Jacques Rousseau",
"Everything is gratuitous, this garden, this city and myself. When you suddenly realize it, it makes you feel sick and everything begins to drift...that's nausea. -- Jean-Paul Sartre",
"Everything flows and nothing stays. -- Heraclitus",
"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. -- Albert Einstein",
"Executives are like joggers. If you stop a jogger, he goes on running on the spot. If you drag an executive away from his business, he goes on running on the spot, pawing the ground, talking business. -- Jean Baudrillard",
"Failure, then, failure! so the world stamps us at every turn. We strew it with our blunders, our misdeeds, our lost opportunities, with all the memorials of our inadequacy to our vocation. And with what a damning emphasis does it then blot us out! -- William James",
"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm those only who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. -- Cesare Beccaria",
"Fashion is something barbarous, for it produces innovation without reason and imitation without benefit. -- George Santayana",
"Feminist confidence that the whole human race can be 'reeducated' to totally eliminate the possibility of rape is pure folly...Wave after wave of boys hit puberty every year. Do feminists, with their multicultural pretensions, really envision a massive export of white bourgeois good manners all around the world? Speak of imperialism! -- Camille Paglia",
"Few persons care to study logic, because everybody conceives himself to be proficient enough in the art of reasoning already. But I observe that this satisfaction is limited to one's own ratiocination, and does not extend to that of other men. -- Charles Peirce",
"For him she is sex - absolute sex, no less. She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute - she is the Other. -- Simone de Beauvoir",
"For a man can lose neither the past nor the future; for how can one take from him that which is not his? So remember these two points: first, that each thing is of like form from everlasting and comes round again in its cycle, and that it signifies not whether a man shall look upon the same things for a hundred years or two hundred, or for an infinity of time; second, that the longest lived and the shortest lived man, when they come to die, lose one and the same thing. -- Marcus Aurelius",
"For I do not seek to understand that I may believe, but I believe in order to understand. For this I believe -- that unless I believe, I should not understand. -- Saint Anselm",
"For knowledge is itself power. -- Francis Bacon",
"For man, when perfected, is the best of animals, but when separated from law and justice, he is the worst of all, since armed injustice is the more dangerous, meant to be used by intelligence and virtue, he is the most unholy and savage of all animals, and the worst of full of lust and gluttony. -- Aristotle",
"For words are wise men's counters, they do but reckon with them; but they are the money of fools. -- Thomas Hobbes",
"From infancy, almost, the average girl is told that marriage is her ultimate goal; therefore her training and education must be directed towards that end. Like the mute beast fattened for slaughter, she is prepared for that. -- Emma Goldman",
"Give me chastity and continence, but not yet. -- Saint Augustine",
"God can stand being told by Professor Ayer and Marghanita Laski that He doesn't exist. -- John B Priestley",
"God may be understood to be similar to a lifeguard who sees a drowning child and, although perfectly capable of saving the unfortunate waif, does nothing and lets her drown. -- Peter Fosl",
"God not only plays dice. He also sometimes throws the dice where they cannot be seen. -- Stephen Hawking",
"Government has no other end but the preservation of property. -- John Locke",
"Great men can't be ruled. -- Ayn Rand",
"Great indebtedness does not make men grateful, but vengeful; and if a little charity is not forgotten, it turns into a gnawing worm. -- Friedrich Nieztsche",
"Happiness consists in frequent repetition of pleasure. -- Arthur Schopenhauer",
"Happiness is the only sanction of life; where happiness fails, existence remains a mad and lamentable experiment. -- George Santayana",
"Hatred comes from the heart; contempt from the head; and neither feeling is quite within our control. -- Arthur Schopenhauer",
"Having been teaching ethics for a very long time...I'm struck by how little reference is ever made to the terrible things that have happened in the 20th Century. Ethics ought to be rooted in some idea of the way in which human nature can go wrong and produce these disasters. -- Jonathan Glover",
"Having the fewest wants, I am nearest to the gods. -- Socrates",
"He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief. Certainly the best works, and of greatest merit for the public, have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men; which both in affection and means, have married and endowed the public. -- Francis Bacon",
"He was an embittered atheist (the sort of atheist who does not so much disbelieve in God as personally dislike Him). -- George Orwell",
"He who establishes a tyranny and does not kill Brutus, and he who establishes a democratic regime and does not kill the sons of Brutus, will not last long. -- Niccolo Machiavelli",
"He who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god. -- Aristotle",
"Hegel says somewhere that all great events and personalities in world history reappear in one fashion or another. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second as farce. -- Karl Marx",
"Hell is other people! -- Jean-Paul Sartre",
"Hence, it will be found that the fundamental fault of the female character is that it has no sense of justice. This is mainly due to the fact, already mentioned, that women are defective in the power of reasoning and deliberation; but it is also traceable to the position which Nature has assigned to them as the weaker sex. They are dependent not upon strength, but upon craft, and hence their instinctive capacity for cunning, and their incredible tendency to say what is not true. -- Arthur Schopenhauer",
"His high pitched voice already stood out above the general murmur of well-behaved junior executives grooming themselves for promotion within the Bell corporation. Then he was suddenly heard to say: 'No, I'm not interested in developing a powerful brain. All I'm after is just a mediocre brain, something like the President of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.' -- Alan Turing",
"His mind is open; yes, it is so open that nothing is retained; ideas simply pass through him. -- Francis Bradley",
"History aside, the almost universal opinion that one's own religious convictions are the reasoned outcome of a dispassionate evaluation of all the major alternatives is almost demonstrably false for humanity in general. If that really were the genesis of most people's convictions, then one would expect the major faiths to be distributed more or less randomly or evenly over the globe. But in fact they show a very strong tendency to cluster...which illustrates what we all suspected anyway: that social forces are the primary determinants of religious belief for people in general. To decide scientific questions by appeal to religious orthodoxy would therefore be to put social forces in place of empirical evidence. -- Paul Churchland",
"History is little else than a picture of human crimes and misfortunes. -- Francois Voltaire",
"History is philosophy derived from examples. -- Dionysius of Halicarnassus",
"Homosexuality is not 'normal.' On the contrary, it is a challenge to the norm; therein rests its eternally revolutionary character. Note I do not call it a challenge to the idea of the norm. Queer theorists - that wizened crew of flimflamming free-loaders - have tried to take the poststructuralist tack of claiming that there is no norm, since everything is relative and contingent. This is the kind of silly bind that word-obsessed people get into when they are deaf, dumb, and blind to the outside world. Nature exists, whether academics like it or not. And in nature, procreation is the single, relentless rule. That is the norm. Our sexual bodies were designed for reproduction. Penis fits vagina: no fancy linguistic game - playing can change that basic fact. However, my libertarian view, here as in regard to abortion, is that we have not only the right, but the obligation to defy nature's tyranny. The highest human identity consists precisely in such assertions of freedom against material limitation. -- Camille Paglia",
"How good one feels when one is full - how satisfied with ourselves and with the world! People who have tried it, tell me that a clear conscience makes you very happy and contented; but a full stomach does the business quite as well, and is cheaper, and more easily obtained. One feels so forgiving and generous after a substantial and well-digested meal - so noble-minded, so kindly-hearted. -- Jerome K. Jerome",
"How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, 'This is better than we thought! The universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant. God must be even greater than we dreamed.' Instead they say, 'No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.' -- Carl Sagan",
"How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unnaccountable as the appearance of the Djinn when Aladdin rubbed his lamp, or any other ultimate fact of nature. -- Thomas Huxley",
"Hubris is today our entire attitude towards nature, our rape of nature with the help of machines. -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"Human-reality is free because it is not enough. It is free because it is perpetually wrenched away from itself and because it has been separated by a nothingness from what it is and from what it will be. -- Jean-Paul Sartre",
"Human law is law only by virtue of its accordance with right reason, and by this means it is clear that it flows from Eternal law. In so far as it deviates from right reason it is called an Unjust law; and in such a case, it is no law at all, but rather an assertion of violence. -- Thomas Aquinas",
"Humans ought to preserve for themselves an environment adequate to match their capacity to wonder. -- Holmes Rolston III",
"I am that gadfly which God has attached to the state, and all day long and in all places am always fastening upon you, arousing and persuading and reproaching you. -- Socrates",
"I am also at this point accustomed to reaffirm with emphasis my conviction that the sun is real, and also that it is hot - in fact hot as Hell, and that if the metaphysicians doubt it they should go there and see. -- Winston Churchill",
"I am not one of those who think that the people are never in the wrong. They have been so, frequently and outrageously, both in other countries and in this. But I do say, that in all disputes between them and their rulers, the presumption is at least upon a par in favour of the people. -- Edmund Burke",
"I am too much of a sceptic to deny the possibility of anything. -- Thomas Huxley",
"I assert that a man has no reason to be ashamed of having an ape for a grandfather. If there were an ancestor whom I should feel shame in recalling, it would rather be a man endowed with great ability and a splendid position who used those gifts to obscure the truth. -- Thomas Huxley",
"I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts. I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world, together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself in nature. -- Albert Einstein",
"I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy he did his best to dispense with God. But he could not avoid making Him set the world in motion with a flip of His thumb; after that he had no more use for God. -- Blaise Pascal",
"I cannot think of the present state of humanity as that in which it is destined to remain; I am absolutely unable to conceive of this as its complete and final vocation....Only in so far as I can regard this state as the means towards a better, as the transition-point to a higher and more perfect state, has it any value in my eyes. -- Johann Fichte",
"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. -- Francois Voltaire",
"I do not recommend any legislative action against hermeneutics. I am a liberal person opposed to all unnecessary state limitation of individual liberties. Hermeneutics between consenting adults should not in my view be the object of any statutory restrictions. I know, only too well, what it would entail. Hermeneutic speakeasies would spring up all over the place, smuggled Thick Descriptions would be brought in by the lorry-load from Canada by the Mafia, blood and thick meaning would clot in the gutter as rival gangs of semiotic bootleggers slugged it out in a series of bloody shoot-outs and ambushes. Addicts would be subject to blackmail. Consumptions of deep meanings and its attendant psychic consequences would in no way diminsh, but the criminal world would benefit, and the whole fabric of civil society would be put under severe strain. Never! -- Ernest Gellner",
"I don't believe in natural science. -- Kurt Godel",
"I don't think we should have an arrangement by which parents decide what children they want. That would not be a happy state of affairs because the rich would have magnificant babies and the poor would have to put up with what God sends. -- Michael Dummett",
"I had rather believe all the fables in the Legend, and the Talmud, and the Alcoran, than that this universal frame is without a mind. And therefore, God never wrought miracle, to convince atheism, because his ordinary works convince it. It is true, that a little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion. -- Francis Bacon",
"I have an extreme dislike for vague, confused, and oracular writing; and I have very little patience with authors who express themselves in this style. I believe that what can be said at all can be said simply and clearly in any civilized language or in a suitable system of symbols, and that verbal obscurity is almost always a sign of mental confusion. -- Charlie D. Broad",
"I have been taken aback by the inexplicable hostility of Mary Midgleys assault. Some colleagues have advised me that such transparent spite is best ignored, but others warn that the venomous tone of her article may conceal the errors in its content. Indeed, we are in danger of assuming that nobody would dare to be so rude without taking the elementary precaution of being right in what she said. We may even bend over backwards to concede some of her points, simply in order to appear fair-minded when we deplore the way she made them. I deplore bad manners as strongly as anyone, but more importantly I shall show that Midgley has no good point to make. -- Richard Dawkins",
"I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection. -- Charles Darwin",
"I have no reason for believing the existence of matter. I have no immediate intuition thereof: neither can I immediately, from any sensations, ideas, notions, actions or passions infer an unthinking, unperceiving, inactive substance - either by probable deduction or necessary consequence. -- George Berkeley",
"I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others -- Marcus Aurelius",
"I have read your paper with great interest. I agree entirely with all the underlying assumptions. As soon as Russia rejected the Baruch proposals, I urged that all nations favouring international control of atomic energy should form an Alliance, and threaten Russia with war unless Russia agreed to come in and permit inspection. -- Bertrand Russell",
"I haven't a clue what it is to give a sense to a notion; the notion of giving sense to a notion hasn't been given a sense, either in this context or, as far as I know, in any other. (I've been told that sense are sometimes given to concepts at Oxford after the gates close to visitors; but that may be a leg-pull.) -- Jerry Fodor",
"I knew he was mortal. -- Anaxagoras",
"I lay it down as a fact that if all men knew what others say of them, there would not be four friends in the world. -- Blaise Pascal",
"I maintain that today many an inventor, many a diplomat, many a financier is a sounder philosopher than all those who practice the dull craft of experimental psychology. -- Oswald Spengler",
"I make no secret of changing my mind on one or two important issues....I've never thought it a virtue to adopt a position and try to get famous as a person who defends that position, like a purveyor of a brand name, like you're selling cornflakes. -- Hilary Putnam",
"I may tell you, between ourselves, that these six Meditations contain all the foundations of my physics.  But please do not tell people, for that might make it harder for supporters of Aristotle to approve them.  I hope that readers will gradually get used to my principles, and recognize their truth, before they notice that they destroy the principles of Aristotle. -- Rene Descartes",
"I myself am human and free only to the extent that I acknowledge the humanity and liberty of all my fellows... I am properly free when all the men and women about me are equally free. Far from being a limitation or a denial of my liberty, the liberty of another is its necessary condition and confirmation. -- Michael Bakunin",
"I never meant to say that the Conservatives are generally stupid. I meant to say that stupid people are generally Conservative. I believe that is so obviously and universally admitted a principle that I hardly think any gentleman will deny it. -- John Stuart Mill",
"I now know all the people worth knowing in America, and I find no intellect comparable to my own. -- Margaret Fuller",
"I refute it thus. -- Samuel Johnson",
"I regret that it has been necessary for me in this lecture to administer a large dose of four-dimensional geometry. I do not apologise, because I am really not responsible for the fact that nature in its most fundamental aspect is four-dimensional. Things are what they are... -- Alfred North Whitehead",
"I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organised in its Churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world. -- Bertrand Russell",
"I should think it is possible for reason to partially subvert faith; this would happen if, for example, there were a really good argument from premises evident to reason for the denial of something central to faith. That is what people who urge anti-theistic arguments - the argument from evil, for example - are trying to come up with. -- Alvin Plantinga",
"I teach you the Overman. Man is something which shall be surpassed. -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"I think it only makes sense to seek out and identify structures of authority, hierarchy, and domination in every aspect of life, and to challenge them; unless a justification for them can be given, they are illegitimate, and should be dismantled, to increase the scope of human freedom. -- Noam Chomsky",
"I think of myself as a very, very second-eleven, even third eleven member of the profession. I think that a lot of women are in that position, for one reason or another, not unfairly, but that's where they belong. -- Mary Warnock",
"I think part of the appeal of mathematical logic is that the formulas look mysterious - You write backward Es! -- Hilary Putnam",
"I think that I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics. -- Richard Feynman",
"I think that in no country in the civilized world is less attention paid to philosophy than in the United States. The Americans have no philosophical school of their own, and they care but little for all the schools into which Europe is divided, the very names of which are scarcely known to them. -- Alexis de Tocqueville",
"I think that philosophy in most aspects is pretty well useless and hopeless unless it's done with other disciplines. And that's the way I like to do it. -- Charles Taylor",
"I think that the Bible as literature should be a compulsory part of the national curriculum – you cant understand English literature and culture without it. But insofar as theology studies the nature of the divine, it will earn the right to be taken seriously when it provides the slightest, smallest smidgen of a reason for believing in the existence of the divine. Meanwhile, we should devote as much time to studying serious theology as we devote to studying serious fairies and serious unicorns. -- Richard Dawkins",
"I think that there are no forces on this planet more dangerous to us all than the fanaticisms of fundamentalism, of all the species: Protestantism, Catholicism, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, as well as countless smaller infections. Is there a conflict between science and religion here? There most certainly is. -- Daniel Dennett",
"'I think, therefore I am,' is the statement of an intellectual who underrates toothaches. -- Milan Kundera",
"I want death to find me planting my cabbages. -- Michel de Montaigne",
"I was not even satisfied with the usual debauchery, because the only thing it dirties is debauchery itself, while, in some way or other, anything sublime and perfectly pure is left intact by it. My kind of debauchery soils not only my body and my thoughts, but also anything I may conceive in its course, that is to say, the vast starry universe, which merely serves as a backdrop. -- Georges Bataille",
"I was told that the Chinese said they would bury me by the Western Lake and build a shrine to my memory. I have some slight regret that this did not happen, as I might have become a god, which would have been very chic for an atheist. -- Bertrand Russell",
"I wish to propose for the reader's favourable consideration a doctrine which may, I fear, appear wildly paradoxical and subversive. The doctrine in question is this: that it is undesirable to believe a proposition when there is no ground whatever for supposing it true. -- Bertrand Russell",
"I wish, my dear Kepler, that we could have a good laugh together at the extraordinary stupidity of the mob. What do you think of the foremost philosophers of this University? In spite of my oft-repeated efforts and invitations, they have refused, with the obstinacy of a glutted adder, to look at the planets or Moon or my telescope. -- Galileo",
"I worry about the worth of philosophy done by philosophers who have been trained in nothing else. -- David Papineau",
"I would not live forever because we should not live forever, because if we were supposed to live forever then we would live forever, but we cannot live forever, which is why I would not live forever. -- Miss Alabama",
"Ideology...is indispensable in any society if men are to be formed, transformed and equipped to respond to the demands of their conditions of existence. -- Louis Althusser",
"If a little knowledge is dangerous, where is a man who has so much as to be out of danger? -- Thomas Huxley",
"If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties. -- Francis Bacon",
"If a man were to say he chose something impossible he would be thought a fool; but we can wish for things that are impossible, for instance immortality. -- Aristotle",
"If an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared. -- Niccolo Machiavelli",
"If chance is defined as an event produced by random motion without any causal nexus, I would say that there is no such thing as chance. -- Boethius",
"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. -- Francois Voltaire",
"If hanging a man in effigy would produce the same salutary impression of terror upon the minds of the people, it would be folly or cruelty ever to hang a man in person. -- Jeremy Bentham",
"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. -- Isaac Newton",
"If it be a short and violent death, we have no leisure to fear it; if otherwise, I perceive that according as I engage myself in sickness, I do naturally fall into some disdain and contempt of life. -- Michel de Montaigne",
"If justice and righteousness perish, human life would no longer have any value in the world. -- Immanuel Kant",
"If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament. -- Germaine Greer",
"If my interlocutor desires to convince me that Jupiter has inhabitants, and that his description of them is accurate, it is for him to bring forward evidence in support of his contention. The burden of proof evidently lies on him; it is not for me to prove that no such beings exist before my non-belief is justified, but for him to prove that they do exist before my belief can be fairly claimed. Similarly, it is for the affirmer of God's existence to bring evidence in support of his affirmation; the burden of proof lies on him. -- Annie Wood Besant",
"If one man offers you democracy and another offers you a bag of grain, at what stage of starvation will you prefer the grain to the vote? -- Bertrand Russell",
"If only there were a way to start a city or an army made up of lovers and the boys they love! Theirs would be the best possible system of society, for they would hold back from all that is shameful, and seek honor in each other's eyes. Even a few of them, in battle side by side, would conquer the world, I'd say. For a man in love would never allow his loved one, of all people, to see him leaving ranks or dropping weapons. He'd rather die a thousand deaths! And as for leaving the boy behind, or not coming to his aid in danger - why, no one is so base that true love could not inspire him with courage, and make him as brave as if he'd been born a hero. -- Plato",
"If some great Power would agree to make me always think what is true and do what is right, on condition of being turned into a sort of clock and wound up every morning before I got out of bed, I should instantly close with the offer. -- Thomas Huxley",
"If the question is asked, what are the most intelligent and all-round-capable things on earth, the answer is obvious: human beings. Everyone knows this, except certain religious people. A person is certainly a believer in some religion if he thinks, for example, that there are on earth millions of invisible and immortal nonhuman beings which are far more intelligent and capable than we are. But that is exactly what sociobiologists do think, about genes. Sociobiology, then, is a religion: one which has genes as its gods. -- David Stove",
"If the world was without any natural evil and suffering we wouldn't have the opportunity, or nearly as much opportunity, to show courage, patience and sympathy. -- Richard Swinburne",
"If triangles made a god, they would give him three sides. -- Charles de Montesquieu",
"If we think that this search for God is a vain search, and that there is no reality to be discovered, ... then the history of religion becomes a study of the aberrations of the human mind. -- Cyril Bailey",
"If you hear that someone is speaking ill of you, instead of trying to defend yourself you should say: 'He obviously does not know me very well, since there are so many other faults he could have mentioned'. -- Epictetus",
"If you talk to God, you are praying; if God talks to you, you have schizophrenia. -- Thomas Szasz",
"If you want to find out anything from the theoretical physicists about the methods they use, I advise you to stick closely to one principle: Don't listen to their words, fix your attention on their deeds. -- Albert Einstein",
"If you would be a real seeker after truth, you must at least once in your life doubt, as far as possible, all things. -- Rene Descartes",
"If you're not shocked by quantum theory, then you don't understand it. -- Neils Bohr",
"If you're doing philosophy at all, if you're engaged in the way that ideas work, then it's a male peculiarity to wish to go right up in the air and go round in circles without relating them to anything else. -- Mary Midgley",
"Illness is the night-side of life, a more onerous citizenship. Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place. -- Susan Sontag",
"I'm very proud that some people think that I'm a danger for the intellectual health of students. When people start thinking of health in intellectual activities, I think there is something wrong. In their opinion I am a dangerous man, since I am a crypto-Marxist, an irrationalist, a nihilist. -- Michel Foucault",
"Immortality. I notice that as soon as writers broach this question they begin to quote. I hate quotation. Tell me what you know. -- Ralph Waldo Emerson",
"In a universe of electrons and selfish genes, blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won't find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference. -- Richard Dawkins",
"In all ages of the world, priests have been enemies of liberty. -- David Hume",
"In an uncorrupted woman the sexual impulse does not manifest itself at all, but only love; and this love is the natural impulse of a woman to satisfy a man. -- Johann Fichte",
"In every adversity of fortune the most unhappy sort of misfortune is to have been happy. -- Boethius",
"In general, I feel if you can't say it clearly you don't understand it yourself. -- John Searle",
"In history, in social life, nothing is fixed, rigid or definitive. And nothing ever will be. -- Antonio Gramsci",
"In masculine hands logic is often a form of violence, a sly kind of tyranny. -- Simone de Beauvoir",
"In my opinion, a mathematician, in so far as he is a mathematician, need not preoccupy himself with philosophy - an opinion, moreover, which has been expressed by many philosophers. -- Henri Lebesgue",
"In my own experience, I have been amazed to see how unrealistic are the bases for political opinion in general. Only rarely have I found a person who has chosen any particular political party - democratic or totalitarian - through study and comparison of principles. -- Joost A. Merloo",
"In my studies of astronomy and philosophy I hold this opinion about the universe, that the Sun remains fixed in the centre of the circle of heavenly bodies, without changing its place; and the Earth, turning upon itself, moves round the Sun. -- Galileo",
"In passing from history to nature, myth acts economically: it abolishes the complexity of human acts, it gives them the simplicity of essences, it does away with all dialectics, with any going back beyond what is immediately visible, it organizes a world which is without contradictions because it is without depth, a world wide open and wallowing in the evident, it establishes a blissful clarity: things appear to mean something by themselves. -- Roland Barthes",
"In practice all men are atheists; they deny their faith by their actions. -- Ludwig Feuerbach",
"In science, 'fact' can only mean 'confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.' I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms. -- Stephen Jay Gould",
"In scientific thought we adopt the simplest theory which will explain all the facts under consideration and enable us to predict new facts of the same kind. The catch in this criterion lies in the world 'simplest.' It is really an aesthetic canon such as we find implicit in our criticisms of poetry or painting. -- John Haldane",
"In so far as a scientific statement speaks about reality, it must be falsifiable: and in so far as it is not falsifiable, it does not speak about reality. -- Karl Popper",
"In the consciousness of the truth he has perceived, man now sees everywhere only the awfulness or the absurdity of existence... and loathing seizes him.  -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"In the domain of political economy, free scientific inquiry does not merely meet the same enemies as in all other domains. The peculiar nature of the material it deals with summons to the fray on the opposing side the most violent, sordid and malignant passions of the human breast, the Furies of private interest. The Established church, for instance, will more readily pardon an attack on thirty-eight of its thirty-nine articles than on one thirty-ninth of its income. -- Karl Marx",
"In the information age, you don't teach philosophy as they did after feudalism. You perform it. If Aristotle were alive today he'd have a talk show. -- Timothy Leary",
"In the matters we propose to investiage, our inquiries should be directed, not to what others have thought, nor to what we ourselves conjecture, but to what we can clearly and distinctly see and with certainty deduce, for knowledge is not won in any other way. -- Rene Descartes",
"In the ordinary, everyday understandings of the words involved, to say that someone survived death is to contradict yourself; while to assert that all of us live forever is to assert a manifest falsehood, the flat contrary of a universally known truth: namely, the truth that all human beings are mortal. For when, after some disaster, the 'dead' and the 'survivors' have both been listed, what logical space remains for a third category? -- Antony Flew",
"In the strict sense of the term, a true democracy has never existed, and will never exist. It is against natural order that the great number should govern and that the few should be governed. -- Jean Jacques Rousseau",
"Increasingly, academic jobs are awarded on the strength of the publications of the candidates.... And it is a sad fact that young women publish less than young men because they're busy having children. -- Mary Warnock",
"Information can tell us everything. It has all the answers. But they are answers to questions we have not asked, and which doubtless don't even arise. -- Jean Baudrillard",
"Injustice, poverty, slavery, ignorance - these may be cured by reform or revolution. But men do not live only by fighting evils. They live by positive goals, individual and collective, a vast variety of them, seldom predictable, at times incompatible. -- Isaiah Berlin",
"Insomnia can become a form of contemplation. You just lie there, inert, helpless, alone, in the dark, and let yourself be crushed by the inscrutable tyranny of time. -- Thomas Merton",
"Is it honest for me to go and sit there on communion day and drink the wine and eat the bread while feeling it all to be mummery? -- John Fiske",
"Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. -- Ralph Waldo Emerson",
"It is a great advantage for a system of philosophy to be substantially true. -- George Santayana",
"It is a little embarrassing that, after 45 years of research and study, the best advice I can give to people is to be a little kinder to each other. -- Aldous Huxley",
"It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. -- Alfred North Whitehead",
"It is a simple logical truth that, short of mass emigration into space, with rockets taking off at the rate of several million per second, uncontrolled birth-rates are bound to lead to horribly increased death-rates. It is hard to believe that this simple truth is not understood by those leaders who forbid their followers to use effective contraceptive methods. They express a preference for 'natural' methods of population limitation, and a natural method is exactly what they are going to get. It is called starvation. -- Richard Dawkins",
"It is absurd to hold that a man ought to be ashamed of being unable to defend himself with his limbs, but not of being unable to defend himself with speech and reason (logos), when the use of rational speech is more distinctive of a human being than the use of his limbs. -- Aristotle",
"It is better to be feared than loved, more prudent to be cruel than compassionate. -- Niccolo Machiavelli",
"It is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a pig satisfied. -- John Stuart Mill",
"It is both necessary to say and think that being is: for to be is possible, and nothingness is not possible. -- Parmenides",
"It is easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them. -- Alfred Adler",
"It is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving, it consists in professing to believe what one does not believe. -- Thomas Paine",
"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our necessities but of their advantages. -- Adam Smith",
"It is not he who reviles or strikes you who insults you, but your opinion that these things are insulting. -- Epictetus",
"It is not in giving life but in risking life that man is raised above the animal; that is why superiority has been accorded in humanity not to the sex that brings forth but to that which kills. -- Simone de Beauvoir",
"It is often said that experiments should be made without preconceived ideas. That is impossible. -- Henri Poincare",
"It is only our bad temper that we put down to being tired or worried or hungry; we put our good temper down to ourselves. -- C. S. Lewis",
"It is pathetic to observe how lowly the motives are that religion, even the highest, attributes to the deity... To be given the best morsel, to be remembered, to be praised, to be obeyed blindly and punctiliously - these have been thought points of honor with the gods. -- George Santayana",
"It is quite gratifying to feel guilty if you haven't done anything wrong: how nobel! Whereas it is rather hard and certainly depressing to admit guilt and to repent. -- Hannah Arendt",
"It is strange, this painless death. Like stepping through a door held politely open for him. It doesn't seem right, somehow; a trivialization of the event. Death ought to be harder to achieve. Better to be hunted down, rooted out, hurting and bloody. Then death would come as a relief. It would be welcome. -- Richard Selzer",
"It is the customary fate of new truths to begin as heresies and to end as superstitions. -- Thomas Huxley",
"It is the highest impertinence and presumption, therefore, in kings and ministers, to pretend to watch over the economy of private people, and to restrain their expense, either by sumptuary laws, or by prohibiting the importation of foreign luxuries.  -- Adam Smith",
"It is the task of radical thought, since the world is given to us unintelligibly, to make it more unintelligible, more enigmatic, more fabulous. -- Jean Baudrillard",
"It is thus clear that, just as some are by nature free, others are by nature slaves, and for these latter the condition of slavery is both beneficial and just. -- Aristotle",
"It is true that liberty is precious - so precious that it must be rationed. -- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin",
"It seemed the world was divided into good and bad people. The good ones slept better...while the bad ones seemed to enjoy the waking hours much more. -- Woody Allen",
"It's an insult to God to believe in God.... So my suspicion is that the people he really loves best now in the twentieth century are probably the atheists and agnostics, because they're the only ones who have ever really taken him seriously. -- Galen Stawson",
"It's strange that people don't recognise the enormous decline in taste melody, rhythm, harmony and invention since the days of Elvis, Chuck Berry and The Beatles. -- Roger Scruton",
"I've never known such adversarial people as women philosophers. I certainly don't think that they're little timid creatures that can't speak up in a seminar. Far from it - they sometimes dominate the scene. -- Mary Warnock",
"Judges and legislators seem frequently to have had quite insanely distorted views about what is a proper proportion between the crime and the punishment. For unfair, harsh and even positively barbarous practices have often enough been enshrined in law. Our moral reformer might back up his case with a short reading list, which could include, e.g. What Nearly Happened to Galileo; What Actually Happened to the Gunpowder Conspirators; A Short History of the Navy; For the Term of His Natural Life (by Marcus Clarke, 1874); and Oscar Wildes two letters to the Daily Chronicle (1897). -- Jenny Teichmann",
"Know thyself. -- Thalse Miletus",
"Language is a form of human reason and has its reasons which are unknown to man. -- Claude Levi-Strauss",
"Leibniz never married; he had considered it at the age of fifty; but the person he had in mind asked for time to reflect. This gave Leibniz time to reflect, too, and so he never married. -- Bernard Fontenelle",
"Let anyone try, I will not say to arrest, but to notice or attend to, the present moment of time. One of the most baffling experiences occurs. Where is it, this present? It has melted in our grasp, fled ere we could touch it, gone in the instant of becoming. -- William James",
"Let us beware of saying that death is the opposite of life. The living being is only a species of the dead, and a very rare species. -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts. -- Charles Peirce",
"Liberty not only means that the individual has both the opportunity and the burden of choice; it also means that he must bear the consequences of his actions...Liberty and responsibility are inseparable. -- Friederich Hayek",
"Life is tragic simply because the earth turns and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time. Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, which is the only fact we have. -- James Baldwin",
"Life must be lived forward, but can only be understood backward. -- Soren Kierkegaard",
"Look at what Christ said about sin. The sins of the flesh. He said that a man who had looked after a woman lustfully had sinned as much as the man who had seduced her. How absurd! If a man in good health does not experience some kind of sexual reaction when he sees an attractive woman, there is something wrong with him. Paul said some wicked things, but Christ started it. -- Bertrand Russell",
"Love of our country is another of those specious illusions, which have been invented by impostors in order to render the multitude the blind instruments of their crooked designs. -- William Godwin",
"Love, friendship, respect do not unite people as much as common hatred for something. -- Anton Chekhov",
"Man first unconsciously and involuntarily creates God in his own image, and after this God consciously and voluntarily creates man in his own image -- Ludwig Feuerbach",
"Man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much...the wheel, New York, wars, and so on, whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely the dolphins believed themselves to be more intelligent than man for precisely the same reasons. -- Douglas Adams",
"Man has free choice, or otherwise counsels, exhortations, commands, prohibitions, rewards and punishments would be in vain. -- Thomas Aquinas",
"Man is a social animal. -- Benedict Spinoza",
"Man is a useless passion. -- Jean-Paul Sartre",
"Man is by his constitution a religious animal; atheism is against not only our reason, but our instincts. -- Edmund Burke",
"Man is condemned to be free. -- Jean-Paul Sartre",
"Man is physically as well as metaphysically a thing of shreds and patches, borrowed unequally from good and bad ancestors, and a misfit from the start. -- Ralph Waldo Emerson",
"Man is the measure of all things: of those which are, that they are; of those which are not, that they are not. -- Protagoras of Adera",
"Man was made for action, and to promote by the exertion of his faculties such changes in the external circumstances both of himself and others, as may seem most favourable to the happiness of all. -- Adam Smith",
"Mankind are, in all ages, caught by the same baits: the same tricks played over and over again, still trepan them. -- David Hume",
"Many people are afraid of freedom. They are conditioned to be afraid of it. -- Herbert Marcuse",
"Many people would sooner die than think. In fact they do. -- Bertrand Russell",
"Marriage is for women the commonest mode of livelihood, and the total amount of undesired sex endured by women is probably greater in marriage than in prostitution. -- Bertrand Russell",
"Mathematics has the completely false reputation of yielding infallible conclusions. Its infallibility is nothing but identity. Two times two is not four, but it is just two times two, and that is what we call four for short. But four is nothing new at all. And thus it goes on and on in its conclusions, except that in the higher formulas the identity fades out of sight -- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
"Mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true. -- Bertrand Russell",
"Memes now spread around the world at the speed of light, and replicate at rates that make even fruit flies and yeast cells look glacial in comparison. They leap promiscuously from vehicle to vehicle, and from medium to medium, and are proving to be virtually unquarantinable. -- Daniel Dennett",
"Men are deceived if they think themselves free, an opinion which consists only in this, that they are conscious of their actions and ignorant of the causes by which they are determined. -- Benedict Spinoza",
"Men first feel necessity, then look for utility, next attend to comfort, still later amuse themselves with pleasure, thence grow dissolute in luxury, and finally go mad and waste their substance. -- Giambattista Vico",
"Men have never been good, they are not good, they never will be good. -- Karl Barth",
"Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction. -- Blaise Pascal",
"Merely fact-minded sciences make merely fact-minded people. -- Edmund Husserl",
"Metaphysics is the finding of bad reasons for what we believe upon instinct; but to find these reasons is no less an instinct. -- Francis Bradley",
"Modern science disclaims any intention of understanding the hidden nature of things; its philosophy condemns any such endeavour as vague, misleading and altogether unscientific....But I refuse to heed this warning. I agree that the process of understanding leads beyond - indeed far beyond - what a strict empiricism regards as the domain of legitimate knowledge; but I reject such an empiricism. If consistently applied, it would discredit any knowledge whatever and it can be upheld only by allowing it to remain inconsistent. It is permitted this inconsistency because its ruthless mutilation of human experience lends it such a high reputation for scientific severity, that its prestige overrides the defensiveness of its own foundations. Our acknowledgement of understanding as a valid form of knowing will go a long way towards liberating our minds from this violent and inefficient despotism. -- Michael Polanyi",
"Modern art touches a sore spot, or several sore spots, in the ordinary citizen of which he is totally unaware. The more irritated he becomes at modern art the more he betrays the fact that he himself, and his civilization, are implicated in what the artist shows him. -- William Barrett",
"Money does not pay for anything, never has, never will. It is an economic axiom as old as the hills that goods and services can be paid for only with goods and services. -- Alfred Nock",
"Morality is not properly the doctrine of how we may make ourselves happy, but how we may make ourselves worthy of happiness. -- Immanuel Kant",
"Morality in Europe today is herd animal morality - in other words, as we understand it, merely one type of human morality besides which, before which, and after which many other types, above all higher moralities, are, or ought to be, possible. -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"Morality has no terrors for her who has risen beyond good and evil. And though Morality may continue to devour its victims, it is utterly powerless in the face of the modern spirit, that shines in all its glory upon the brow of man and woman, liberated and unafraid. -- Emma Goldman",
"Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday, I dont know. -- Albert Camus",
"My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will. -- William James",
"Natural rights is simple nonsense: natural and imprescriptible rights, rhetorical nonsense - nonsense upon stilts. -- Jeremy Bentham",
"Natural selection is simply about genes replicating themselves down the generations. Genes that build bodies that do what's needed - seeing, running, digesting, mating - get replicated; and those that don't, don't. -- Helena Cronin",
"Nature abhors a vacuum. -- Benedict Spinoza",
"Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. -- Jeremy Bentham",
"Nature is often hidden, sometimes overcome, seldom extinguished. -- Francis Bacon",
"Never forget that only dead fish swim with the stream. -- Malcolm Muggeridge",
"Nietzsche was stupid and abnormal. -- Leo Tolstoy",
"No arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. -- Thomas Hobbes",
"No evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death. -- Plato",
"No man's knowledge here can go beyond his experience. -- John Locke",
"No morality can be founded on authority, even if the authority were divine. -- A. J. Ayer",
"No more fiendish punishment could be devised, were such a thing physically possible, than that one should be turned loose in society and remain absolutely unnoticed by all the members thereof. -- William James",
"No one can be perfectly free till all are free; no one can be perfectly moral till all are moral; no one can be perfectly happy till all are happy. -- Herbert Spencer",
"No philosophy, no religion, has ever brought so glad a message to the world as this good news of Atheism. -- Annie Wood Besant",
"No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish. -- David Hume",
"No theory ever agrees with all the facts in its domain, yet it is not always the theory that is to blame. Facts are constituted by older ideologies, and a clash between facts and theories may be proof of progress. -- Paul Feyerabend",
"Nobody before the Pythagoreans had thought that mathematical relations held the secret of the universe. Twenty-five centuries later, Europe is still blessed and cursed with their heritage. To non-European civilizations, the idea that numbers are the key to both wisdom and power, seems never to have occurred. -- Arthur Koestler",
"Not every problem someone has with his girlfriend is necessarily due to the capitalist mode of production. -- Herbert Marcuse",
"Nothing can be created from nothing. -- Lucretius",
"Nothing appears more surprising to those who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye, than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few. -- David Hume",
"Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion. -- Democritus",
"Nothing happens to any man that he is not formed by nature to bear. -- Marcus Aurelius",
"Now, now my good man, this is no time for making enemies. -- Francois Voltaire",
"Nowadays we all give too much thought to the material blessings or evils that science has brought with it, and too little to its power to liberate us from the confinements of ignorance and superstition. The greatest liberation of thought achieved by the scientific revolution was to have given human beings a sense of future in this world. -- Peter B. Medawar",
"Objective evidence and certitude are doubtless very fine ideals to play with, but where on this moonlit and dream-visited planet are they found? -- William James",
"Of all religions, the Christian is without doubt the one which should inspire tolerance most, although up to now the Christians have been the most intolerant of all men. -- Francois Voltaire",
"On earth there is nothing great but man; in man there is nothing great but mind. -- William Hamilton",
"One can generally say this about men: that they are ungrateful, fickle, simulators and deceivers, avoiders of danger, greedy for gain; and while you work for their good they are completely yours, offering you their blood, their property, their lives, and their sons when danger is far away; but when it comes nearer to you, they turn away. -- Niccolo Machiavelli",
"One declaims endlessly against the passions; one imputes all of man's suffering to them. One forgets that they are also the source of all his pleasures. -- Denis Diderot",
"One feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be 'happy' is not included in the plan of 'Creation'... We are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from a state of things. -- Sigmund Freud",
"One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. -- Simone de Beauvoir",
"One may safely affirm that all popular theology as a kind of appetite for absurdity and contradiction....while their gloomy apprehensions make them ascribe to Him measures of conduct which in human creatures would be blamed, they must still affect to praise and admire that conduct in the object of their devotional addresses. -- David Hume",
"One of the benefits of getting rid of the notion of the intrinsic nature of reality is that you get rid of the notion that quarks and human rights differ in 'ontological status.' This, in turn, helps you reject the suggestion that natural science should serve as a paradigm for the rest of culture, and in particular that philosophical progress consists in philosophers getting more scientific. -- Richard Rorty",
"One of the most constant characteristics of beliefs is their intolerance. The stronger the belief, the greater its intolerance. Men dominated by a certitude cannot tolerate those who do not accept it. -- Gustave Le Bon",
"One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we've been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We're no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It is simply too painful to acknowledge - even to ourselves - that we've been so credulous. -- Carl Sagan",
"One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important. -- Bertrand Russell",
"One phantom is more especially crucial than any other today: the shade of Hegel. To drive this phantom back into the night we need a little more light on Marx, or what is the same thing, a little more Marxist light on Hegel himself. We can then escape from the ambiguities and confusions of the inversion. -- Louis Althusser",
"One should not confuse the craving for life with endorsement of it. -- Elias Canetti",
"One should respect public opinion in so far as is necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny. -- Bertrand Russell",
"One thinks of French philosophy that it aspires to the condition of literature or the condition of art, and that English and American philosophy aspires to the condition of science. French philosophy, one thinks of as picking up an idea and running with it, posibility into a nearby brick wall or over a local cliff, or something like that. -- Ted Honderich",
"Only in the state does man have a rational existence...Man owes his entire existence to the state, and has his being within it alone. Whatever worth and spiritual reality he possesses are his solely by virtue of the state. -- Georg Hegel",
"Opinion is ultimately determined by the feelings, and not by the intellect. -- Herbert Spencer",
"Opposing one species of superstition to another, set them a-quarreling; while we ourselves, during their fury and contention, happily make our escape into the calm, though obscure, regions of philosophy. -- David Hume",
"Our belief in any particular natural law cannot have a safer basis than our unsuccessful critical attempts to refute it. -- Karl Popper",
"Our main conclusions about the state are that a minimal state, limited to the narrow functions of protection against force, theft, fraud, enforcement of contracts, and so on, is justified; that any more extensive state will violate persons' rights not to be forced to do certain things, and is unjustified; and that the minimal state is inspiring as well as right. -- Robert Nozick",
"Ours is a culture of premature ejaculation.... -- Jean Baudrillard",
"Paley's argument is made with passionate sincerity and is informed by the best biological scholarship of his day, but it is wrong, gloriously and utterly wrong. -- Richard Dawkins",
"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. -- Adam Smith",
"Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it. -- Karl Marx",
"Philosophers are as jealous as women. Each wants a monopoly of praise. -- George Santayana",
"Philosophy, as we use the word, is a fight against the fascination which forms of expression exert upon us. -- Ludwig Wittgenstein",
"Philosophy, beginning in wonder ... is able to fancy everything different from what it is. It sees the familiar as if it were strange, and the strange as if it were familiar. It can take things up and lay them down again. Its mind is full of air that plays round every subject. It rouses us from our native dogmatic slumber and breaks up our caked prejudices....A man with no philosophy in him is the most inauspicious and unprofitable of all possible social mates. -- William James",
"Philosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity. A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations. Philosophy does not result in philosophical propositions', but rather in the clarification of propositions. Without philosophy thoughts are, as it were, cloudy and indistinct: its task is to make them clear and to give them sharp boundaries. -- Ludwig Wittgenstein",
"Philosophy is at once the most sublime and the most trivial of human pursuits. -- William James",
"Philosophy removes from religion all reason for existing...As the science of the spirit, it looks upon religion as a phenomenon, a transitory historical fact, a psychic condition that can be surpassed. -- Benedetto Croce",
"Physics investigates the essential nature of the world, and biology describes a local bump. Psychology, human psychology, describes a bump on the bump. -- Willard Quine",
"Plato having defined man to be a two-legged, animal without feathers, Diogenes plucked a cock and brought it into the Academy, and said, 'This is Plato's man.' On which account this addition was made to the definition: 'With broad flat nails.' -- Diogenes Laertius",
"Poets...though liars by profession, always endeavour to give an air of truth to their fictions. -- David Hume",
"Popular psychology is a mass of cant, of slush and of superstition worthy of the most flourishing days of the medicine man. -- John Dewey",
"Progress, therefore, is not an accident, but a necessity... it is part of nature. -- Herbert Spencer",
"Proper names are rigid designators. -- Saul Kripke",
"Puritanism. The haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy. -- H. L. Mencken",
"Religion in its humility restores man to his only dignity, the courage to live by grace. -- George Santayana",
"Religion is an illusion of childhood, outgrown under proper education. -- Auguste Comte",
"Religion is but a desperate attempt to find an escape from the truly dreadful situation in which we find ourselves. Here we are in this wholly fantastic universe with scarcely a clue as to whether our existence has any real significance. No wonder then that many people feel the need for some belief that gives them a sense of security, and no wonder that they become very angry with people like me who say that this is illusory. -- Fred Hoyle",
"Religion is still parasitic in the interstices of our knowledge which have not yet been filled. Like bed-bugs in the cracks of walls and furniture, miracles lurk in the lacunae of science. The scientist plasters up these cracks in our knowledge; the more militant Rationalist swats the bugs in the open. Both have their proper sphere and they should realize that they are allies. -- John Haldane",
"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. -- Karl Marx",
"Religious fundamentalists alone are a huge popular grouping in the United States, which resembles pre-industrial societies in that regard. This is a culture in which three-fourths of the population believe in religious miracles, half believe in the devil, 83 percent believe that the Bible is the 'actual' or the inspired word of God, 39 percent believe in the Biblical prediction of Armageddon and 'accept it with a certain fatalism,' a mere 9 percent accept Darwinian evolution while 44 percent believe that 'God created man pretty much in his present form at one time within the last 10,000 years,' and so on. The 'God and Country rally' that opened the national Republican convention is one remarkable illustration, which aroused no little amazement in conservative circles in Europe. -- Noam Chomsky",
"Religious tolerance has developed more as a consequence of the impotence of religions to impose their dogmas on each other than as a consequence of spiritual humility in the quest for understanding first and last things. -- Sidney Hook",
"Remember that no man loses any other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses. -- Marcus Aurelius",
"Rome has spoken; the case is concluded. -- Saint Augustine",
"Scepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and it is shameful to surrender it too soon or to the first comer. -- George Santayana",
"Science is a great and glorious enterprise - the most successful, I argue, that human beings have ever engaged in. To reproach it for its inability to answer all the questions we should like to put to it is no more sensible than to reproach a railway locomotive for not flying or, in general, not performing any other operation for which it was not designed. -- Peter B. Medawar",
"Science is built up with facts, as a house is with stones. But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house. -- Henri Poincare",
"Science is much closer to myth than a scientific philosophy is prepared to admit. It is one of the many forms of thought that have been developed by man, and not necessarily the best. It is conspicuous, noisy, and impudent, but it is inherently superior only for those who have already decided in favour of a certain ideology, or who have accepted it without ever having examined its advantages and its limits. -- Paul Feyerabend",
"Science is no longer the quintessence of knowledge and of what is worth knowing, but a way. It is a way of addressing and penetrating into unexplored and unmasked realms. -- H.G. Gagamer",
"Science is organised knowledge. -- Herbert Spencer",
"Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition. -- Adam Smith",
"Science may be described as the art of systematic over-simplification. -- Karl Popper",
"Scientific knowledge, even in the most modest persons, has mingled with it a something which partakes of insolence. Absolute, peremptory facts are bullies. -- Oliver Wendell Holmes",
"Scientists animated by the purpose of proving that they are purposeless constitute an interesting subject for study. -- Alfred North Whitehead",
"Scipio used to say that he was never less idle than when he had nothing to do and never less lonely than when he was alone. An admirable sentiment, in truth, and becoming to a great and wise man. -- Marcus Cicero",
"Self-consciousness exists in and for itself when, and by the fact that, it so exists for another; that is, it exists only in being acknowledged -- Georg Hegel",
"Semiology has taught us that myth has the task of giving an historical intention a natural justification, and making contingency appear eternal. -- Roland Barthes",
"Sex-appeal is the keynote of our whole civilisation. -- Henri Bergson",
"Shouldn't I join the ranks of academic philosophers and merely make unsubstantiated claims about the wonders of human consciousness? Shouldn't I stop trying to do some science and keeping my head down? Indeed not. -- Kevin Warwick",
"Since each person, as an individual, is the not-being of the other, it is never possible to eliminate non-understanding completely. -- Friedrich Schleiermacher",
"Since the order of the world is shaped by death, mightn't it be better for God if we refuse to believe in Him, and struggle with all our might against death without raising our eyes towards the heaven where He sits in silence? -- Albert Camus",
"Since we are in the main not sceptics, we might go on and frankly confess to each other the motives for our several faiths. I frankly confess mine - I cannot but think that at bottom they are of an aesthetic and not of a logical sort. -- William James",
"Six is a number perfect in itself, and not because God created the world in six days; rather the contrary is true. God created the world in six days because this number is perfect, and it would remain perfect, even if the work of the six days did not exist. -- Saint Augustine",
"'Slapdash egoism, Midgley says, is not really a very puzzling phenomenon. Nor, I suppose, is slapdash discussion (even in a reputable philosophical journal); but it is deplorable. -- J. L. Mackie",
"So act as to treat humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of any other, in every case as an end withal, never as means only. -- Immanuel Kant",
"So far as the mere imparting of information is concerned, no university has had any justification for existence since the popularization of printing in the fifteenth century. -- Alfred North Whitehead",
"So, I am a bastard, and the English are bastards. But the really bad news is that you are too. My vision of Europe would be Europe of bastards for whom the question of legitimacy was a site of endless struggle and contestation... -- Simon Critchley",
"So the experience of death is turned into that of the exchange of functionaries, and anything in the natural relationship to death that is not wholly absorbed into the social one is turned over to hygiene. In being seen as no more than the exit of a living creature from the social combine, death has been domesticated... -- Theodore Adorno",
"Society is indeed a contract...it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born. -- Edmund Burke",
"Sociology is the science with the greatest number of methods and the least results. -- Henri Poincare",
"Socrates is a doer of evil, who corrupts the youth; and who does not believe in the gods of the state, but has other divinities of his own. Such is the charge. -- Plato",
"Socrates said, 'Bad men live that they may eat and drink, whereas good men eat and drink that they may live'. -- Plutarch",
"Socrates said he was not an Athenian or a Greek, but a citizen of the world. -- Plutarch",
"Socrates thought that if all our misfortunes were laid in one common heap, whence every one must take an equal portion, most persons would be contented to take their own and depart. -- Plutarch",
"Socrates was the first to call philosophy down from the heavens and to place it in cities, and even to introduce it into homes and compel it to enquire about life and standards and good and ill. -- Cicero",
"Some circumstantial evidence is very strong, as when you find a trout in the milk. -- Henry David Thoreau",
"Some people talk in their sleep. Lecturers talk while other people sleep. -- Albert Camus",
"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. -- Sigmund Freud",
"Statistics are the triumph of the quantitative method, and the quantitative method is the victory of sterility and death. -- Hillaire Belloc",
"Such evil deeds could religion prompt. -- Lucretius",
"Suicide is not abominable because God prohibits it; God prohibits it because it is abominable. -- Immanuel Kant",
"Talk sense to a fool and he calls you foolish. -- Euripides",
"That the glory of this world...is appearance leaves the world more glorious, if we feel it is a show of some fuller splendour; but the sensuous curtain is a deception...if it hides some colourless movement of atoms, some...unearthly ballet of bloodless categories. -- Francis Bradley",
"The action is best, which procures the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers. -- Francis Hutcheson",
"The aim of philosophy is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term. -- Wilfred Sellars",
"The banality of evil. -- Hannah Arendt",
"The basic anxiety, the anxiety of a finite being about the threat of non-being, cannot be eliminated. It belongs to existence itself. -- Paul Tillich",
"The beauty of the democratic systems of thought control, as contrasted with their clumsy totalitarian counterparts, is that they operate by subtly establishing on a voluntary basis - aided by the force of nationalism and media control by substantial interests - presuppositions that set the limits of debate, rather than by imposing beliefs with a bludgeon. -- Noam Chomsky",
"The believer who has communicated with his god is not merely a man who sees new truths of which the unbeliever is ignorant: he is a man who is 'stronger'. He feels within him more force, either to ensure the trials of existence, or to conquer them. It is as though he were raised above the miseries of the world, because he is raised above his condition as man. -- Emile Durkheim",
"The blind willingness to sacrifice people to truth, however, has always been the danger of an ethics abstracted from life. -- Carol Gilligan",
"The body is not a permanent dwelling, but a sort of inn...which is to be left behind when one perceives that one is a burden to the host. -- Lucius Annaeus Seneca",
"The brain therefore you speak of, being a sensible thing, exists only in the mind. -- George Berkeley",
"The centre of me is always and eternally a terrible pain. -- Bertrand Russell",
"The challenge of modernity is to live without illusions and without becoming disillusioned. -- Antonio Gramsci",
"The characteristic of the hour is that the commonplace mind, knowing itself to be commonplace, has the assurance to proclaim the rights of the commonplace and to impose them wherever it will. -- Jose Ortega y Gasset",
"The chief merit of language is clearness, and we know that nothing detracts so much from this as do unfamiliar terms. -- Galen",
"The Christian religion not only was at first attended with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed by any reasonable person without one. -- David Hume",
"The clouds of my grief dissolved and I drank in the light. With my thoughts recollected I turned to examine the face of my physician. I turned my eyes and fixed my gaze upon her, and I saw that it was my nurse in whose house I had been cared for since my youth - Philosophy. -- Boethius",
"The condition of man...is a condition of war of everyone against everyone. -- Thomas Hobbes",
"The contents of the world are not just there for the knowing but have to be grasped with suitable mental machinery. -- Stephen Pinker",
"The Creator, if He exists, has a special preference for beetles. -- John Haldane",
"The criminal law stands to the passion of revenge in much the same relation as marriage to the sexual appetite. -- James Fitzjames Stephen",
"The 'dark side' of philosophy is compassed both by what it has failed to do in defence and preservation of its own mission - the love of wisdom - and by what this failure has permitted the enemies of open and reasoned inquiry to entrench in its place - the worship of folly. -- Lou Marinoff",
"The day the world ends, no one will be there, just as no one was there when it began. This is a scandal. Such a scandal for the human race that it is indeed capable collectively, out of spite, of hastening the end of the world by all means just so it can enjoy the show. -- Jean Baudrillard",
"The declaration which says that God visits the sins of the fathers upon the children is contrary to every principle of moral justice. -- Thomas Paine",
"The defense of morals is the battle-cry which best rallies stupidity against change. -- Alfred North Whitehead",
"The difference between man and woman is like that between animals and plants. Men correspond to animals, while women correspond to plants because their development is more placid and the principle that underlies it is the rather vague unity of feeling. -- Georg Hegel",
"The 'dirty secret of contemporary neuroscience': we have no idea what the correct level of analysis is, because there is no universally accepted theory of how the brain codes information. -- John Searle",
"The Divine intellect indeed knows infinitely more propositions (than we can ever know). But with regard to those few which the human intellect does understand, I believe that its knowledge equals the Divine in objective certainty. -- Galileo",
"The dogma of the Ghost in the Machine. -- Gilbert Ryle",
"The dream is the small hidden door in the deepest and most intimate sanctum of the soul, which opens into that primeval cosmic night that was soul long before there was a conscious ego and will be soul far beyond what a conscious ego could ever reach. -- Carl Gustave Jung",
"The end of our foundation is the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible. -- Francis Bacon",
"The envious man thinks that if his neighbor breaks a leg, he will be able to walk better himself. -- Helmut Schoeck",
"The expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient. -- Charles Darwin",
"The extension of women's rights is the basic principle of all social progress. -- Charles Fourier",
"The fact of having been born is a bad augury for immortality. -- George Santayana",
"The feminine mystique has succeeded in burying millions of American women alive. -- Betty Friedan",
"The first revolt is against the supreme tyranny of theology, of the phantom of God. As long as we have a master in heaven, we will be slaves on earth. -- Michael Bakunin",
"The freest form of government is only the least objectionable form. The rule of the many by the few we call tyranny: the rule of the few by the many is tyranny also; only of a less intense kind. -- Herbert Spencer",
"The French are wiser than they seem, and the Spaniards seem wiser than they are. -- Francis Bacon",
"The Führer alone is the present and future German reality and its law. Learn to know ever more deeply: from now on every single thing demands decison, and every action responsiblity. -- Martin Heidegger",
"The fundamental sense of freedom is freedom from chains, from imprisonment, from enslavement by others. The rest is extension of this sense, or else metaphor. -- Isaiah Berlin",
"The fundamentalists, by 'knowing' the answers before they start, and then forcing nature into the straitjacket of their discredited preconceptions, lie outside the domain of science - or of any honest intellectual inquiry. -- Stephen Jay Gould",
"The Good of man is the active exercise of his soul's faculties in conformity with excellence or virtue...Moreover this activity must occupy a complete lifetime; for one swallow does not make spring, nor does one fine day; and similarly one day or a brief period of happiness does not make a man supremely blessed and happy. -- Aristotle",
"The good of the people is the highest law. -- Marcus Cicero",
"The great tragedy of Science - the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact. -- Thomas Huxley",

"The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing. -- Blaise Pascal",
"The highest good, then, after the attainment of which the whole of rational nature is seeking, which is also called the end of all blessings, is defined by many philosophers as follows: The highest good, they say, is to become as like to God as possible. -- Origen",
"The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle. -- Karl Marx",
"The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of spirit. -- Georg Hegel",
"The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways -- I to die, and you to live. Which is better God only knows. -- Socrates",
"The human body is the best picture of the soul. -- Ludwig Wittgenstein",
"The human mind evolved to believe in the gods. It did not evolve to believe in biology. Acceptance of the supernatural conveyed a great advantage throughout prehistory, when the brain was evolving. Thus it is in sharp contrast to biology, which was developed as a product of the modern age and is not underwritten by genetic algorithms. The uncomfortable truth is that the two beliefs are not factually compatible. As a result those who hunger for both intellectual and religious truth will never acquire both in full measure. -- Edward O. Wilson",
"The idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the human animal like nothing else; it is a mainspring of human activity - designed largely to avoid the fatality of death, to overcome it by denying in some way that it is the final destiny of man. -- Ernest Becker",
"The idea of God is the sole wrong for which I cannot forgive mankind. -- Marquis de Sade",
"The ideas of Freud were popularised by people who only imperfectly understood them, who were incapable of the great effort required to grasp them in their relationship to larger truths, and who therefore assigned to them a prominence out of all proportion to their true importance. -- Alfred North Whitehead",
"The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. -- Karl Marx",
"The illustrious bishop of Cambrai was of more worth than his chambermaid, and there are few of us that would hesitate to pronounce, if his palace were in flames, and the life of only one of them could be preserved, which of the two ought to be preferred. -- William Godwin",
"The infant runs toward it with its eyes closed, the adult is stationary, the old man approaches it with his back turned. -- Denis Diderot",
"The infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists. That is why they invented Hell. -- Bertrand Russell",
"The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind. -- Sigmund Freud",
"The issues with respect to both relativism and the importance of sociological influences on science might be encapsulated by asking if one could have had a different science if historical conditions had differed... To the relativists the answer must presumably be 'yes', but then the onus is on them to demonstrate the validity of their position. To me, the answer is an unequivocal 'no': the course of science would have been very different, but the ideas would have ended up the same. -- Lewis Wolpert",
"The kindly God who lovingly fashioned each and every one of us and sprinkled the sky with shining stars for our delight - that God is, like Santa Claus, a myth of childhood, not anything a sane, undeluded adult could literally believe in. That God must either be turned into a symbol for something less concrete or abandoned altogether. -- Daniel Dennett",
"The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people. -- John Stuart Mill",
"The life of man is the life of a moving being, and it would not be sufficient for him to develop body alone. A plant is rooted: it stays in one place and cannot move. It would be very surprising, therefore, to discover that a plant had a mind; or at least a mind in any sense which we could comprehend. If a plant could foresee or project consequences, the faculty would be useless to it. What advantage would it be for the plant to think: 'Here is someone coming. In a minute he will tread on me, and I shall be dead underfoot'? The plant would still be unable to move out of the way. All moving beings, however, can foresee and reckon up the direction in which to move; and this fact makes it necessary to postulate that they have minds or souls. -- Alfred Adler",
"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world. -- Ludwig Wittgenstein",
"The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. 'Whither is God? He cried; 'I will tell you. We have killed him - you and I. All of us are his murderers. -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"The man who gets angry at the right things and with the right people, and in the right way and at the right time and for the right length of time, is commended. -- Aristotle",
"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. -- Henry David Thoreau",
"The most detestable wickedness, the most horrid cruelties, and the greatest miseries that have afflicted the human race have had their origin in this thing called revelation, or revealed religion. It has been the most destructive to the peace of man since man began to exist. -- Thomas Paine",
"The most important scientific revolutions all include, as their only common feature, the dethronement of human arrogance from one pedestal after another of previous convictions about our centrality in the cosmos. -- Stephen Jay Gould",
"The most radical revolutionary will become a conservative on the day after the revolution. -- Hannah Arendt",
"The musical emotion springs precisely from the fact that at each moment the composer withholds or adds more or less than the listener anticipates on the basis of a pattern that he thinks he can guess, but that he is incapable of wholly divining. -- Claude Levi-Strauss",
"The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them. -- George Orwell",
"The notion that human life is sacred just because it is human life is medieval. -- Peter Singer",
"The only bodily organ which is really regarded as inferior is the atrophied penis, a girl's clitoris. -- Sigmund Freud",
"The only principle that does not inhibit progress is: anything goes. -- Paul Feyerabend",
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. -- Edmund Burke",
"The Papacy is not other than the ghost of the deceased Roman empire, sitting crowned upon the grave thereof. -- Thomas Hobbes",
"The people recognize themselves in their commodities; they find their soul in their automobile, hi-fi set, split-level home, kitchen equipment. -- Herbert Marcuse",
"The philosopher's task differs from the others', then, in detail; but in no such drastic way as those suppose who imagine for the philosopher a vantage point outside the conceptual scheme that he takes in charge. There is no such cosmic exile. He cannot study and revise the fundamental conceptual scheme of science and common sense without having some conceptual scheme, whether the same or another no less in need of philosophical scrutiny, in which to work. -- Willard Quine",
"The philosophic thesis that all knowledge is ultimately founded in experience has in the end led to a postulate concerning the logical clarification of any statement about nature. Such a postulate may have seemed justified in the period of classical physics, but since quantum theory we have learned that it cannot be fulfilled. -- Werner Heisenberg",
"The praise of ancient authors proceeds not from the reverence of the dead, but from the competition, and mutual envy of the living. -- Thomas Hobbes",
"The present contains nothing more than the past, and what is found in the effect was already in the cause. -- Henri Bergson",
"The principle which regulates the existing social relations between the two sexes - the legal subordination of one sex to the other - is wrong in itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement. -- John Stuart Mill",
"The propositions of mathematics have, therefore, the same unquestionable certainty which is typical of such propositions as 'All bachelors are unmarried,' but they also share the complete lack of empirical content which is associated with that certainty: The propositions of mathematics are devoid of all factual content; they convey no information whatever on any empirical subject matter. -- Carl Hempel",
"The prostitute is not, as feminists claim, the victim of men but rather their conqueror, an outlaw who controls the sexual channel between nature and culture. -- Camille Paglia",
"The puritanism of Christianity has played havoc with the moderation that an enlightened and tolerant critical spirit would have produced. I've noticed that in whatever country, county, town, or other region there is a regulation enjoining temperance, the population seems to be entirely composed of teetotallers and drunkards. There's a Bible on that shelf there. But I keep it next to Voltaire - poison and antidote. -- Bertrand Russell",
"The reading of all good books is like a conversation with the finest men of past centuries. -- Rene Descartes",
"The real question is not whether machines think but whether men do. -- B. F. Skinner",
"The reason that no computer program can ever be a mind is simply that a computer program is only syntactical, and minds are more than syntactical. Minds are semantical, in the sense that they have more than a formal structure, they have a content. -- John Searle",
"The river of my title is a river of DNA, and it flows through time, not space. It is a river of information, not a river of bones and tissues; a river of abstract instructions for building bodies, not a river of solid bodies themselves. -- Richard Dawkins",
"The routine of custom tends to deaden even scientific inquiry; it stands in the way of discovery and of the active scientific worker. For discovery and inquiry are synonymous as an occupation. Science is a pursuit, not a coming into possession of the immutable; new theories as points of view are more prized than discoveries that quantitatively increase the store on hand. -- John Dewey",
"The safest general characterisation of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato. -- Alfred North Whitehead",
"The scientists in question seem to me to confuse the Author of Nature with the Editor of 'Nature'; or at any rate to suppose that there can be no productions of the former which would not be accepted for publication by the latter. And I see no reason to believe this. -- Charlie D. Broad",
"The scientists, not the philosophers, now address most effectively the great questions of existence, the mind, and the meaning of the human condition. -- Edward O. Wilson",
"The sentence 'snow is white' is true if, and only if, snow is white. -- Alfred Tarski",
"The simple point which I am concerned to make is that where ultimate values are irreconcilable, clear-cut solutions cannot, in principle, be found. To decide rationally in such situations is to decide in the light of general ideals, the overall pattern of life pursued by a man or a group or a society. -- Isaiah Berlin",
"The sole criteria of frigidity is the absence of the vaginal orgasm. -- Sigmund Freud",
"The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection. -- John Stuart Mill",
"The Spice Girls? Is it a book? -- Jean Baudrillard",
"The State is not 'abolished', it withers away. -- Friedrich Engels",
"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a human heart. One must imagine that Sisyphus is happy. -- Albert Camus",
"The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related, that it is difficult to class them separately. One step above the sublime makes the ridiculous, and one step above the ridiculous makes the sublime again. -- Thomas Paine",
"The substitution of the proletarian for the bourgeois state is impossible without a violent revolution. -- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin",
"The theory of knowledge which I wish to propose is a largely Darwinian theory of the growth of knowledge. From the amoeba to Einstein, the growth of knowledge is always the same: we try to solve our problems, and to obtain, by a process of elimination, something approaching adequacy in our tentative solutions. -- Karl Popper",
"The thing-in-itself, the will-to-live, exists whole and undivided in every being, even in the tiniest; it is present as completely as in all that ever were, are, and will be, taken together. -- Arthur Schopenhauer",
"The thought of suicide is a great source of comfort: with it a calm passage is to be made across many a bad night. -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"The total absence of humour from the Bible is one of the most singular things in all literature. -- Alfred North Whitehead",
"The total effect of the culture industry is one of anti-enlightenment, in which, as Horkheimer and I have noted, enlightenment, that is the progressive technical domination of nature, becomes mass deception and is turned into a means for fettering consciousness. It impedes the development of autonomous, independent individuals who judge and decide consciously for themselves. -- Theodore Adorno",
"The truth is often a terrible weapon of aggression. It is possible to lie, even to murder, for the truth. -- Alfred Adler",
"The truth is that capitalism has not only multiplied population figures, but at the same time, improved the people's standard of living in an unprecedented way. Neither economic thinking nor historical experience suggest that any other social system could be as beneficial to the masses as capitalism. -- Ludwig von Mises",
"The unexamined life is not worth living. -- Socrates",
"The universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose. -- John Haldane",
"The violence in the world comes about because we human beings are forever creating barriers between men who are like us and men who are not like us. -- Edmund Leach",
"The way in which a girl accepts and keeps the obligatory date, the inflection on the telephone or in the most intimate situation, the choice of words in conversation, and the whole inner life as classified by the now somewhat devalued depth psychology, bear witness to man's attempt to make himself a proficient apparatus, similar (even in emotions) to the model served up by the culture industry. -- Theodore Adorno & Max Horkheimer",
"The way in which the man of genius rules is by persuading an efficient minority to coerce an indifferent and self-indulgent majority. -- James Fitzjames Stephen",
"The word 'revolution' is a word for which you kill, for which you die, for which you send the labouring masses to their death, but which does not possess any content. -- Simone Weil",
"The world is so exquisite, with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence. Far better, it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look Death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides. -- Carl Sagan",
"Theism is so confused and the sentences in which 'God' appears so incoherent and so incapable of verifiability or falsifiability that to speak of belief or unbelief, faith or unfaith, is logically impossible. -- A. J. Ayer",
"There are two kinds of truths: those of reasoning and those of fact. The truths of reasoning are necessary and their opposite is impossible; the truths of fact are contigent and their opposites are possible. -- Gottfried Leibnitz",
"There are two sides to every question. -- Protagoras of Adera",
"There are two sorts of laws, those of absolute equity and universality, and the bizarre ones which owe their autonomy only to blindness or to the force of circumstance. The latter merely cover the man who is breaking them with a passing disgrace, which time then transfers to the judges and the nations, on whom it remains forever. -- Denis Diderot",
"There are, as is known, insects that die in the moment of fertilization. So it is with all joy: life's highest, most splendid moment of enjoyment is accompanied by death. -- Soren Kierkegaard",
"There can be no other truth to take off from than this: I think, therefore, I exist. There we have the absolute truth of consciousness becoming aware of itself. -- Jean-Paul Sartre",
"There can be genuine consensual relationships involving abuse. -- Martha Nussbaum",
"There exists a great chasm between those, on one side, who relate everything to a single central vision...and, on the other side, those who pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory...The first kind of intellectual and artistic personality belongs to the hedgehogs, the second to the foxes. -- Isaiah Berlin",
"There is...only a single categorical imperative and it is this: Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law -- Immanuel Kant",
"There is always something wrong, if one is straining to make the commonplace incomprehensible. -- C. P. Snow",
"There is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval. -- George Santayana",
"There is no female Mozart because there is no female Jack the Ripper. -- Camille Paglia",
"There is no great genius without some touch of madness. -- Lucius Annaeus Seneca",
"There is no history of mankind, there are only many histories of all kinds of aspects of human life. And one of these is the history of political power. This is elevated into the history of the world. -- Karl Popper",
"There is no man so good, who, were he to submit all his thoughts and actions to the laws, would not deserve hanging ten times in his life. -- Michel de Montaigne",
"There is no society known where a more or less developed criminality is not found under different forms. No people exists whose morality is not daily infringed upon. We must therefore call crime necessary and declare that it cannot be non-existent, that the fundamental conditions of social organization, as they are understood, logically imply it. -- Emile Durkheim",
"There is no such thing as society....There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first. -- Margaret Thatcher",
"There is no theory of a God, of an author of nature, of an origin of the Universe, which is not utterly repugnant to my facilities; which is not (to my feelings) so irrelevant as to make me blush; so misleading as to make me mourn. -- Harriet Martineau",
"There is nothing funny about Halloween. This sarcastic festival reflects, rather, an infernal demand for revenge by children on the adult world. -- Jean Baudrillard",
"There is nothing so absurd but some philosopher has said it. -- Cicero",
"There is one, and only one, thing in modern society more hideous than crime - namely, repressive justice -- Simone Weil",
"There is perhaps no phenomenon which contains so much destructive feeling as 'moral indignation,' which permits envy or hate to be acted out under the guise of virtue. -- Erich Fromm",
"There is something stunningly narrow about how the Anthropic Principal is phrased. Yes, only certain laws and constants of nature are consistent with our kind of life. But essentially the same laws and constants are required to make a rock. So why not talk about a Universe designed so rocks could one day come to be, and strong and weak Lithic Principals? If stones could philosophize, I imagine Lithic Principals would be at the intellectual frontiers. -- Carl Sagan",
"There will be no end to the troubles of states, or indeed of humanity itself, till philosophers become kings in this world, or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers. -- Plato",
"Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a prime mover, put in motion by no other; and this everyone understands to be God. -- Thomas Aquinas",
"Therefore something than which greater cannot be thought undoubtedly exists both in thought and in reality... And you, Lord God, are this being. -- Saint Anselm",
"They that approve a private opinion, call it opinion; but they that mislike it, heresy: and yet heresy signifies no more than private opinion. -- Thomas Hobbes",
"They that deny a God destroy man's nobility; for certainly man is of kin to the beasts by his body; and, if he be not of kin to God by his spirit, he is a base and ignoble creature. -- Francis Bacon",
"This brings me to the first point I want to make about what this book is not. I am not advocating a morality based on evolution. I am saying how things have evolved. I am not saying how we humans morally ought to behave. -- Richard Dawkins",
"This is a mistake which I seem to make eternally, that I imagine the sufferings of others as far greater than they really are. Ever since my childhood, the proposition 'my greatest dangers lie in pity' has been confirmed again and again. -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"This survival of the fittest which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called “natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life. -- Herbert Spencer",
"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. -- George Santayana",
"Thus it is that no group ever sets itself up as the One without at once setting up the Other over against itself. If three travellers chance to occupy the same compartment, that is enough to make vaguely hostile 'others' out of all the rest of the passengers on the train. In small-town eyes all persons not belonging to the village are 'strangers' and suspect; to the native of a country all who inhabit other countries are 'foreigners'; Jews are 'different' for the anti-Semite, Negroes are 'inferior' for American racists, aborigines are 'natives' for colonists, proletarians are the 'lower class' for the privileged. -- Simone de Beauvoir",
"Time heals what reason cannot. -- Lucius Annaeus Seneca",
"'Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger. -- David Hume",
"To assert that the earth revolves around the sun is as erroneous as to claim that Jesus was not born of a virgin. -- Cardinal Bellarmine",
"To command the professors of astronomy to confute their own observations is to enjoin an impossibility, for it is to command them not to see what they do see, and not to understand what they do understand, and to find what they do not discover. -- Galileo",
"To doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions; both dispense with the necessity of reflection. -- Henri Poincare",
"To fear death, my friends, is only to think ourselves wise, without being wise: for it is to think that we know what we do not know. For anything that men can tell, death may be the greatest good that can happen to them: but they fear it as if they know quite well that it was the greatest of evils. And what is this but that shameful ignorance of thinking that we know what we do not know? -- Socrates",
"To found a great empire for the sole purpose of rasing up a people of customers may at first sight appear a project fit only for a nation of shopkeepers. It is, however, a project altogether unfit for a nation of shopkeepers; but extremely fit for a nation whose Government is influenced by shopkeepers. -- Adam Smith",
"To prefer evil to good is not in human nature; and when a man is compelled to choose one of two evils, no one will choose the greater when he may have the less. -- Socrates",
"To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I confess, absurd in the highest degree. -- Charles Darwin",
"To the philosophical eye the vices of the clergy are far less dangerous than their virtues. -- Edward Gibbon",
"To this day, and in quarters where they should know better, Darwinism is widely regarded as a theory of 'chance'. It is grindingly, creakingly, crashingly obvious that, if Darwinism were really a theory of chance, it couldn't work. -- Richard Dawkins",
"To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature ... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in. -- Richard Feynman",
"Truth is, to be sure, an absolute notion, in the following sense: 'true for me but not for you' and 'true in my culture but not in yours' are weird, pointless locutions. So is 'true then but not now.' -- Richard Rorty",
"Those who assert that the mathematical sciences say nothing of the beautiful or the good are in error. For these sciences say and prove a great deal about them; if they do not expressly mention them, but prove attributes which are their results or definitions, it is not true that they tell us nothing about them. The chief forms of beauty are order and symmetry and definiteness, which the mathematical sciences demonstrate in a special degree. -- Aristotle",
"Twice, when an honest, unequivocal, perfectly scientific way of thinking had been attained with tremendous fortitude and self-overcoming, the Germans managed to find devious paths to the old 'ideal' -- at bottom, formulas for a right to repudiate science, a right to lie. Leibniz and Kant - these two greatest brake shoes of intellectual integrity in Europe -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"Universal doubt cancels itself. -- Edmund Husserl",
"Up till now, I have not attended to Dawkins, thinking it unnecessary to break a butterfly upon a wheel. But Mr Mackie's article is not the only indication I have lately met of serious attention paid to his fantasies. -- Mary Midgley",
"Upon the whole, I am inclined to think that the far greater part, if not all, of those difficulties which have hitherto amused philosophers, and blocked up the way to knowled ge, are entirely owing to ourselves. We have first raised a dust, and then complain we cannot see. -- George Berkeley",
"Use your health, even to the point of wearing it out. That is what it is for. Spend all you have before you die; and do not outlive yourself. -- George Bernard Shaw",
"Vertigo is anguish to the extent that I am afraid not of falling over the precipice, but of throwing myself over. -- Jean-Paul Sartre",
"Virtue, then, is a state of character concerned with choice, lying in the mean which is defined by reference to reason. It is a mean between two vices, one of excess and one of deficiency; and again, it is a mean because the vices respectively fall short or exceed what is right in both passions and actions, while virtue both finds and chooses that which is intermediate. -- Aristotle",
"Wandering in a vast forest at night, I have only a faint light to guide me. A stranger appears and says to me: 'My friend, you should blow out your candle in order to find your way more clearly.' The stranger is a theologian. -- Denis Diderot",
"War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things: the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing worth a war, is worse. A war to protect other human beings against tyrannical injustice; a war to give victory to their own ideas of right and good, and which is their own war, carried on for an honest purpose by their own free choice - is often the means of their regeneration. -- John Stuart Mill",
"We agree that what is holy is loved by the Gods because it is holy, and not holy because it is loved by the gods. -- Plato",
"We are mad, not only individually, but nationally. We check manslaughter and isolated murders; but what of war and the much vaunted crime of slaughtering whole peoples? -- Lucius Annaeus Seneca",
"We are never so defenceless against suffering as when we love. -- Sigmund Freud",
"We are shut out of all power and authority, by reason we are never employed either in civil or martial affairs, our counsels are despised, and laughed at, the best of our actions are trodden down with scorn, by the over-weening conceit, men have of themselves, and through a despisement of us. -- Margaret Cavendish",
"We are survival machines - robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes. This is a truth which still fills me with astonishment. -- Richard Dawkins",
"We feel and know that we are eternal. -- Benedict Spinoza",
"We have a habit in writing articles published in scientific journals to make the work as finished as possible, to cover up all the tracks, to not worry about the blind alleys or describe how you had the wrong idea first, and so on. So there isn't any place to publish, in a dignified manner, what you actually did in order to get to do the work. -- Richard Feynman",
"We have long convinced ourselves...that the existence of even the most subtle of the 'invisible' things postulated by the scientist is verified, in principle, in exactly the same way as the reality of a tree or a star. -- Moritz Schlick",
"We have unmistakable proof that throughout all past time, there has been a ceaseless devouring of the weak by the strong. -- Herbert Spencer",
"We must also suppose that before that time, the progress of reason will have gone hand in hand with progress in the arts and sciences; that the ridiculous prejudices of superstition will no longer cover morality with an austerity that corrupts and degrades it instead of purifying and elevating it. Men will know then that if they have obligations to beings who do not yet exist, these obligations do not consist in giving life, but in giving happiness. Their object is the general welfare of the human species, of the society in which people live, of the family to which they belong and not the puerile idea of filling the earth with useless and unhappy beings. -- Marquis de Condorcet",
"We must not believe the many, who say that only free people ought to be educated, but we should rather believe the philosophers who say that only the educated are free. -- Epictetus",
"We wish, in a word, equality - equality in fact as corollary, or rather, as primordial condition of liberty. From each according to his faculties, to each according to his needs; that is what we wish sincerely and energetically. -- Michael Bakunin",
"What could be more clear or obvious when we look up to the sky and contemplate the heavens, than that there is some divinity of superior intelligence? (Lucilius) -- Cicero",
"What a country calls its vital economic interests are not the things which enable its citizens to live, but the things which enable it to make war. Gasoline is much more likely than wheat to be a cause of international conflict. -- Simone Weil",
"What a fine comedy this world would be if one did not play a part in it! -- Denis Diderot",
"What every genuine philosopher...craves most is praise - although the philosophers generally call it 'recognition'! -- William James",
"What experience and history teach us is this - that people and governments have never learned anything from history, or acted upon any lessons they might have drawn from it. -- Georg Hegel",
"What improves the circumstances of the greater part can never be regarded as an inconveniency to the whole. No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable. -- Adam Smith",
"What is freedom of expression? Without the freedom to offend, it ceases to exist. -- Salmon Rushdie",
"What is morality in any given time or place? It is what the majority then and there happen to like, and immorality is what they dislike. -- Alfred North Whitehead",
"What progress we are making. In the Middle Ages they would have burned me. Now they are content with burning my books. -- Sigmund Freud",
"What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence. -- Ludwig Wittgenstein",
"What you do not wish others should do unto you, do not do unto them. -- Confucius",
"When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong. -- Arthur C. Clarke",
"When he to whom one speaks does not understand, and he who speaks himself does not understand, that is metaphysics. -- Francois Voltaire",
"When knowledge is the slave of social considerations, it defines a special class; when it serves its own ends only, it no longer does so. There is of course a profound logic in this paradox: genuine knowledge is egalitarian in that it allows no privileged source, testers, messengers of Truth. It tolerates no privileged and circumscribed data. The autonomy of knowledge is a leveller. -- Ernest Gellner",
"When women forge their own 'gender identity', in the way the feminists recommend, they become unattractive to men - or attractive only as sex objects, not as individual persons. And when men cease to be gentlemen, they become unattractive to women. Sexual companionship then goes from the world. -- Roger Scruton",
"When you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second. When you sit on a red-hot cinder a second seems like an hour. That's relativity. -- Albert Einstein",
"Whenever kingship approaches tyranny it is near its end, for by this it becomes ripe for division. -- Nicolas Oresme",
"Whenever morality is based on theology, whenever right is made dependent on divine authority, the most immoral, unjust, infamous things can be justified and established. -- Ludwig Feuerbach",
"Who can refute a sneer? -- William Paley",
"Who were the fools who spread the story that brute force cannot kill ideas? Nothing is easier. And once they are dead they are no more than corpses. -- Simone Weil",
"Why on earth do would-be feminists adopt male standards of how to be sexual? -- Helena Cronin",
"Why, then, do you walk as if you had swallowed a ramrod? -- Epictetus",
"Woman can be emancipated only when she can take part on a large social scale in production and is engaged in domestic work only to an insignificant degree. And this has become possible only in the big industry of modern times, which not only admits of female labour on a grand scale but even formally demands it. -- Friedrich Engels",
"Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or, at best, cows. -- Friedrich Nietzsche",
"Women are systematically degraded by receiving the trivial attentions which men think it manly to pay to the sex, when, in fact, men are insultingly supporting their own superiority. -- Mary Wollstonecraft",
"Work banishes those three great evils, boredom, vice and poverty. -- Francois Voltaire",
"Yet it moves. -- Galileo",
"You are a philosopher, Dr. Johnson. I have tried too in my time to be a philosopher; but I don't know how, cheerfulness was always breaking in. -- Oliver Edwards",
"You do pay a price for stating it simply, namely it's easier for the professionals to misunderstand it. -- John Searle",
"You have already grasped that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He is, as much through his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing. -- Albert Camus",
"You might just take Bertrand Russell on a beach holiday, as I once did; but Kant, never. -- Simon Blackburn");
