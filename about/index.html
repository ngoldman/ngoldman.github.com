  <p>
    <strong>Hi! My name's Nate, and I'm an internet addict</strong>. They say acceptance is the
    first step on the road to recovery.
    I love creating new ways of communicating and
    understanding information, and I've been learning and building on the web for
    about as long as it's existed as a publicly accessible resource. I first heard
    the sound of a modem connecting to the internet back in 1989 when I was about
    six years old, and I've been hooked ever since.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm currently focusing on deepening my knowledge of geographical information
    systems, bidirectional real time communication channels
    (primarily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" target="_blank">WebSocket</a>),
    and new kinds of web server software like Node.js to see if I
    can play a part in shaping the next generation of web applications.
  </p>

  <!-- <p>
    <strong>I grew up in Los Angeles, California and Paris, France</strong>
    and had the good
    fortune of growing up trilingual, learning English, French and Spanish as a
    young boy. My Spanish isn't as good as it used to be but I'm still fully
    fluent in French, and I'm always up for practicing or learning a new language.
    I studied Philosophy and Linguistics at UC Santa Cruz and Web Design and
    Interactive Media at the Art Institute of Portland, earning a Bachelor of Arts
    from the former and a Bachelor of Science from the latter.
  </p> -->

  <p>
    I've been living in Portland, Oregon for close to three years and I'm
    thoroughly enjoying the good coffee, beer, books, and the blossoming
    technology industry.

    <strong>If you need to get in touch with me</strong> I'm active on
    <a href="http://twitter.com/n8ji">twitter</a> and IRC (you can sometimes
    find me at #pdxtech on irc.freenode.net as @ngoldman) and I also check my
    <a href="mailto:nate@ngoldman.me">email</a> regularly. If I don't respond
    right away, I'm probably buried under a pile of work, but I'll get back to
    you as soon as I can. Thanks for visiting!
