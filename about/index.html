  <p><strong>I am Nate Goldman</strong>. Amongst my coworkers I am one of three; we are called the unicorns. We have a unicorner. Within the confines of that corner we work together by design and by code to bring about a new tomorrow for America's youth and also Geographic Information Systems.</p>

  <p>If you need to get in touch with me, I check <a href="mailto:nate@ngoldman.me">email</a> regularly.</p>

  <p>I sometimes <a href="http://twitter.com/n8ji">tweet</a> about arcane programming subjects and fart jokes.</p>
