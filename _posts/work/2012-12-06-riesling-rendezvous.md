Riesling Rendezvous is an annual wine tasting event hosted by
Chateau Ste. Michelle and Dr. Loosen at Chateau Ste. Michelle and the Bell
Harbor International Conference Center in Seattle, Washington.

I built the back end of this site using Ruby on Rails, and integrated static
front end templates from an outside developer. The administration section
features a custom content management system for handling guest registrations.
