This was a group project for Chuck Vose's Rapid Web Development class in the
Fall of 2011. The goal of the project was to design and implement a redesign
of the Art Institute of Portland's website. The project was not meant to be a
complete redesign, only a conceptual piece to show the style we wanted to
portray. Andrew Tibbs took care of the design and Marilyn Yu wrote the HTML
and CSS, while I took care of the back end code. I wrote the server architecture
in Ruby using the Sinatra framework and added some simple authentication to
simulate a password-protected student portal.

The code for this project is open source and is available [here](https://github.com/ngoldman/aipd-redesign).
