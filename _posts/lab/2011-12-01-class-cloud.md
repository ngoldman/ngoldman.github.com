This was a group project for Chuck Vose's Rapid Web Development class in the
Fall of 2011. The concept I came up with was to develop a cloud service that
allows students to track classes, assignments and files. The motivation was to
create a single site that consolidated the many disparate online services
students often use, allowing them to keep track of important information related
to school in one place on the web.

I acted as project manager, working with four other students to build a
prototype of this service in four weeks. We used Ruby on Rails for the back end,
the paperclip gem to handle file versions, and pushState with jquery-pjax to
make the application as quick and seamless as possible. We also had two
designers working on wireframing, site structure and iconography.
