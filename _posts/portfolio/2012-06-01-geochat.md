Geochat is a simple service that lets you create a chat room and talk to people
from anywhere in the world, with one twist -- you're on a map. Anyone who joins
the chat shares their location in real time and can see where everyone else is
too. The service works on browsers as well as iPhones and runs remarkably fast
too.

Geochat was a project I worked on for an independent study to further my
knowledge of geolocation and mapping while exploring WebSocket technology as
well as a host of new frameworks. I built the backend using Ruby on Rails
and PostgreSQL, and built the user interface using Backbone.js, Pusher,
CoffeeScript and SASS. This was basically an attempt to learn everything I
could about a host of technologies I was curious about within a limited time
frame (11 weeks). I had a lot of fun building it and hope to keep developing
it as a full-fledged service in the future.
