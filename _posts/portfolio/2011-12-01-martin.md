Martin is a Ruby/Sinatra web application boilerplate optimized for immediate
deployment to Heroku. A lot of the code comes from Kyle Drake's
Sammy Davis Junior boilerplate. This project was my attempt to distill all of
the essentials of web application development with Sinatra that I had learned
while working at [Dachis Group](http://www.dachisgroup.com/)
into a useful contribution to the open source community.
