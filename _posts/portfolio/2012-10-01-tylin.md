The TY Lin site existed before I came to [Fine](http://finedesigngroup.com),
but I inherited the responsibilities of maintaining it and working on new
features. There are some exciting new features I've worked on that I can't
talk about yet, but one prominent feature I worked that has been released was
linking news articles to projects. This required some database work,
adding some interface elements to the administration side of the site to
allow TY Lin employees to select projects to link to articles, and making sure
those links show up in the right places throughout the site.
