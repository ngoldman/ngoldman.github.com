This was my first project as a web developer at
[Fine](http://www.finedesigngroup.com/). I worked primarily on the front end
code, building out the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to drive the user experience
for a large, sortable, filterable table with detailed data collected from
the exoskeleton device Ekso Bionics had just released to a handful of
hospitals around the world. I also helped design and implement some of the
database queries and back end logic for the complex search filtering that our
client had requested.
