The focus for this site was using animation to tell a story about common
problems people have with their PCs, and some helpful solutions that Symantec
offers through its Norton Utilities software. I worked on this project as a web
developer at [Fine](http://www.finedesigngroup.com), where I was just one part
of a large team with many moving parts: a designer, photographer, model and
account manager in San Francisco, a project manager in Portland, and Symantec's
public relations team in Australia all played a role. My job was to work
directly with the designer and project manager to develop a compelling
interactive experience.

As a developer, I was responsible for all front-end code (HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript) and back-end code (Ruby on Rails). This site makes heavy use of
JavaScript and jQuery to drive the animation. It also uses URL hashes to handle
navigating each part of the story.

One of the most interesting pieces of animation is the first part of the
[clutter](http://www.befriendswithyourpc.com/#clutter) section, which features a
function that randomly places a collection of application icons and makes them
appear with an elastic easing effect. The elastic easing equation was courtesy
of the [jQuery Easing](http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing) plugin, and the
random placement function was my own invention.
