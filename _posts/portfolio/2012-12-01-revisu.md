Revisu was a tech startup at the
[Portland Incubator Experiment](http://www.piepdx.com/), also known as PIE.
Working with Revisu was an exciting experience, as I got to spend time with
[Clifton](http://blog.wk.com/2012/04/04/wker-series-meet-clifton/) and
[Brad](https://twitter.com/bradhe) working on innovative ideas and stretching
the limits of my abilities as a developer.

I was brought onto the Revisu team as a freelancer to help with
an application architecture overhaul. Brad, the CEO and lead engineer, wanted to
create a more robust and efficient user experience. My work focused on
reorganizing and rewriting a lot of the JavaScript code and helping Brad plan
and implement a series of changes to the file management interface, detailed in
[this article](http://www.revisu.com/2012/04/04/the-new-revisu-is-here/). I
also helped refine the user interface for the commenting system and the design
view in general.

Here is some more press Revisu garnered during the time I was there:
