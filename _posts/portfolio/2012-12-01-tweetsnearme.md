Tweets Near Me was a personal project that I worked on in several classes to
learn more about mapping, geolocation, third-party APIs and Node.js. The
concept was to provide an easy interface for finding out what people on twitter
were saying nearby based on the user's location. The application used the HTML5
geolocation API to get the user's location straight from the browser, and also
supported searching for tweets by location.
