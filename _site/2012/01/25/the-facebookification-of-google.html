  <h2>The Facebookification of Google</h2>
  <article>
    <p>I read an <a href='http://www.extremetech.com/computing/115425-google-is-fubar'>excellent article</a> [<a href='http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3510109'>hn</a>] this morning analyzing Google&#8217;s decision to consolidate 60 of its 70 privacy policies into one &#8220;Main Privacy Policy.&#8221; A telling provision has been piggybacked into this legal shift &#8211; the policy includes a clause mandating the sharing of data across all of Google&#8217;s platforms, and there is no option to opt out.</p>

<p>The move seems to be indicative of a pretty serious shift in philosophy on the part of Google&#8217;s leadership. Rather than bank on their dominance in indexed search to fund cutting edge ventures, they&#8217;re trying to compete with Facebook while letting the competition define the term of success &#8211; the &#8220;walled garden&#8221; approach that has successfully trapped more than 800 million users[<a href='http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics'>?</a>] in the unhappy echo chamber where the bulk of the social marketplace now resides.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m happy to hear this, but it seems Google is determined to compete in the social marketplace. From the uninformed shareholder&#8217;s perspective, it would be dumb not to, but from a web developer&#8217;s perspective, they&#8217;re playing catch-up in an over-saturated market run by multinationals who are consistently losing the loyalty of their users due to a lack of basic respect for their customer&#8217;s intelligence and time. Doing so is going to grow their user base at the cost of lowering the worth of their information, the experience of using their products, and the value of using their products to interact with others.</p>

<p>Breaking into the social space is a losing game. The smart move is to invest in mobile ventures harnessing geolocation and using game mechanics to draw in willing users and reward them in the real world, rather them drawing them into a vortex of recycled and repackaged memes. You can&#8217;t trick a smart user into using your products or seeing your content &#8211; I for one will immediately avoid your company and its products if you attempt to do so. Success comes from creating experiences that people enjoy and want to repeat and share with their friends. Model your product strategy on that, not on copying the trickster king of the social network.</p>
